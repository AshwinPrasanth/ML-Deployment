However, the terms and conditions of this contract will apply to all plans and all claims made under the policy. Therefore where we refer to ‘you’ and ‘your’ throughout this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to members of group schemes. If you are a member of a group scheme where your employer has arranged your cover and is paying all or part of your premium, the Group Schemes section in this Membership Handbook will also apply to you. You must ensure that the information that is provided to us when you are taking out a policy (whether in an application form or otherwise) is accurate and complete (even where the information is being provided to us by someone on your behalf). Otherwise it could mean we won’t pay a claim under the policy and some or all of the members’ plans under the policy may be cancelled. This may also cause difficulty should you wish to purchase health insurance elsewhere. Understanding your cover Health insurance cover can be difficult to understand so to help you check your cover we have set out a checklist below. We understand that it may be difficult for you to figure out whether you are covered yourself so if you’re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we ’ll walk you through it. In fact we would always advise you to check your cover with us before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility. When checking your cover with us you will need to tell us where you intend to have the procedure or treatment performed; the name of your health care provider and the procedure/treatment code. You can get this information from your health care provider. The checklists below explain what to look for to see if you are covered under your Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits. You will notice that some of your benefits will be classed as Maternity Benefits or Other Benefits on your Table of Cover. Some of these benefits are claimed as Out- patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits and the checklists below will apply to these.Day-To-Day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits What to look for Where to check >Is the benefit covered under your plan? >How much will we pay? >Is there an excess?Your Table of Cover >What terms and conditions apply to the benefit? >Does a waiting period apply? >How can you claim?Your Membership Handbook >What does the benefit cover? >Are there any further criteria?The Lists (if applicable) In-patient Benefits What to look for Where to check >Is the treatment or procedure an established treatment? >Is the treatment or procedure medically necessary? >Is your health care provider registered with Irish Life Health and a participating health care provider? >Will you be admitted to a medical facility and if so which one? >If not, where will you be having your procedure or treatment performed?Your health care provider >Is your treatment or procedure covered (is it listed in the Schedule of Benefits)? >Do any clinical indicators apply and do you meet them? >Does your treatment or procedure need to be pre-authorised? >Is your treatment or procedure covered when it is carried out by the type of health care provider you are attending (i.e. is it covered when carried out by a GP , dentist, oral surgeon, periodontist)? >If your treatment or procedure is not going to be performed in a hospital or treatment centre, is it covered when it is carried out in your health care provider’s rooms?The Schedule of Benefits or your health care provider >Which List of Medical Facilities applies to you ? >What’s your level of cover? i.e. Do you need to pay an excess, shortfall or co-payment?Table of Cover >If you are being admitted to a medical facility, is it included in the Lists of Medical Facilities covered under your plan? >Does a waiting period apply? >How can you claim? >Are"}

They also show if we pay them directly (known as direct settlement) or if you need to pay them yourself and claim this back from us. You will be covered for the medical facilities specified in one of four lists shown in the tables (your “List of Medical Facilities”). Your Table of Cover shows which List of Medical Facilities applies to you . Table of Cover Your Table of Cover sets out the benefits that are available under your plan. The Schedule of Benefits The Schedule of Benefits is sectioned by specialty and sets out the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these need to be pre-authorised. It shows the clinical indicators that must be present in order for a procedure or treatment to be covered. It also specifies that certain treatments and procedures will only be covered if they are performed by a certain type of health care provider or if they are performed in a certain place (i.e. in a hospital). The GP section sets out the procedures and treatments that we will cover when they are carried out by your GP in their surgery. It also shows which of these procedures and treatments require pre-authorisation and sets out any clinical indicators that apply. These documents contain medical language which is really designed to be read by doctors and consultants. For this reason, we would advise you to contact us or your health care provider before undergoing your procedure or treatment to confirm whether it will be covered by us. The Schedule of Benefits can be accessed on our website at www.irishlifehealth.ie/privacy-and-legal/schedule-of- benefits or a hard copy can be requested from us. The Lists These Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and in some cases contain criteria which must be satisfied before the benefit will apply. We will let you know throughout this Membership Handbook or in your Table of Cover when it is necessary to refer to a List in connection with a benefit. The Lists are available on our website www.irishlifehealth.ie/privacy-and- legal/schedule-of-benefits. The following is a brief explanation of each of the Lists: 1. The List of Special Procedures This confirms which procedures are covered under the Listed Special Procedures benefit. See section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further information on this benefit.2. The List of Cardiac Procedures This confirms which procedures are covered under the Listed Cardiac Procedures benefit.

The List of Post-Operative Home Help (POHH) Procedures The post-operative home help benefit is only available following certain procedures. These are set out in the List of Post-Operative Home Help (POHH) Procedures. 4. The List of Medical and Surgical Appliances This list confirms the medical and surgical appliances for which you can claim a contribution from us under the medical and surgical appliances benefit. It also sets out the contribution that can be claimed for each appliance. 5.

The List of Cardiac Procedures Subject to Co-Payment This list specifies the cardiac procedures where a co-payment applies when such procedures are carried out in a private or high-tech hospital. 7. The List of Clinical Indicators for Cardiac MRI and Cardiac CT Scans This list sets out the clinical indicators that must be satisfied for cardiac MRI and cardiac CT scans. 8.

Approval is only given where the procedure or treatment meets specific clinical indicators or we determine that it will result in a reasonably favourable medical prognosis. If your treatment or procedure needs to be pre- authorised, this will be specified in the Schedule of Benefits. To apply for pre-authorisation, your health care provider must submit a request in writing to Irish Life Health in order for your claim to be considered. We will assess your request as soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days. The treatment must begin, or surgical procedure must be performed, before your pre-authorisation expires. Your pre- authorisation will end either six months from when it is granted, or if you change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you cease to be a member of Irish Life Health, whichever is sooner. Your health care provider In most cases your treatment or procedure will be carried out by your consultant but there are some treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by your GP , dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. The professional fees of health professionals can be covered as an In-patient Benefit, an Out-patient Benefit or a Day-to-day Benefit depending on type of care you receive. Generally when you receive a procedure or treatment that is listed in the Schedule of Benefits, your health care provider’s fees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits. We fully cover health care providers who are registered with us and have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their professional fees (i.e. a participating health care provider). You will have to pay most, or all, of your health care provider’s fees yourself if they are not registered with us or are not participating. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for a full explanation about how your health care provider’s professional fees are covered under your In-patient Benefits. Generally an out-patient consultation with a consultant or a visit to your GP or dentist will be covered as a Day-to-day Benefit or an Out-patient Benefit. In these circumstances it doesn’t matter if your consultant/GP/dentist is registered with Irish Life Health or is participating. Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits usually allow you to claim a contribution from us towards a certain number of visits to your consultant/GP/dentist in your policy year. If these benefits are available under your plan, the amount you can claim back per visit and the number of visits for which you can claim will be shown in your Table of Cover. Waiting periods Your medical expenses will not be covered until after your waiting periods have expired. Waiting periods are explained in section 6 of this Membership Handbook. Excess/Shortfall/Co-payment You will need to pay any excess, shortfall or co-payment that applies to a benefit or a group of benefits under your plan. You can’t claim these expenses back from us. You can see if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies by checking your Table of Cover. See sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for more information on excesses, shortfalls and co-payments.Understanding changes to your cover 1. Changes to your plan on renewal From time to time we alter the benefits available under our plans. If we alter the plan that you are on, the benefit changes will not affect you during your policy year but will apply if you purchase that plan at your next renewal. Therefore, it is important to remember that where you renew on the same plan the benefits may not be the same as they were in your previous policy year. 2. Changes to your cover throughout your policy year In some cases the cover that is available under your plan may change throughout your policy year for the following reasons: Changes to the Schedule of Benefits We review and where necessary amend the Schedule of Benefits regularly to update the procedures and treatments that are covered by us and the clinical indicators, conditions of payment and/or payment indicators that apply to procedures and treatments. These changes may become effective during your policy year. You can find the most current versions of these on our website or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover. Changes to the Lists of Medical Facilities We may add medical facilities to the Lists of Medical Facilities from time to time. We may also need to remove medical facilities from the Lists of Medical Facilities if our arrangement with those medical facilities ends. The medical facilities which will be paid directly by us may also change from time to time. See section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further details. You can"}

In particular, you are confirming that you understand the contractual documents that make up your contract with us and that your cover may change throughout your policy year. 2 Your Cover & How to Claim The benefits available under your plan are shown in your Table of Cover. They are divided into different sections mainly due to how they are claimed or the type of expenses covered. The following sections of this Membership Handbook explain the different types of benefits offered by us. Within each section is a table which lists our benefits, shows the terms and conditions that apply to each benefit, and tells you how to claim it. Please note that all these benefits may not be available under your plan. You should check your Table of Cover to see which benefits apply to you and how much you can claim under each benefit. You will also be able to see on your Table of Cover if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies. How our benefits are categorised can change on different plans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear in different sections in this Membership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is not explained in the corresponding table in this Membership Handbook, please check the tables in other sections of this Membership Handbook. The terms and conditions that apply to our benefits (as described in the tables below) will always apply even if the benefit is positioned in a different section of your Table of Cover. If a day-to-day excess or an out-patient excess applies to your plan, this will apply per policy year and will always affect all the benefits included in those sections of your Table of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one or more of your Day-to-day Benefits or Out- patient Benefits appear in a different section in this Membership Handbook. You will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for the medical services listed in those regulations (subject to any waiting periods). Please see section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook for an explanation of the Minimum Benefit Regulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or other deductions required by law before paying your claim.2.1 Day-to-Day and Out-patient Benefits These benefits typically allow you to claim a contribution from us towards visits to certain medical practitioners or for certain medical services. The amounts that can be claimed and frequency or number of visits they apply to are set out in your Table of Cover. Where contributions are listed as a single amount, they are claimable once per policy year unless otherwise stated. Please see the “How to calculate your cover under your Day-To-Day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits” section below for details on how you may be covered under these benefits. You can claim these benefits for medical services received in Ireland or when you are abroad. Day-to-day Benefits are not included on all plans. If they are not covered on your plan and you wish to add day-to-day cover to your plan, please call our customer service team on 01 562 5100 to see what options are available to you . There may be instances where benefits in the Out-patient and Day-to-day sections apply to the same medical expenses. In this instance when claiming online, please check your Table of Cover to choose the section you wish to claim under. You cannot claim for the same medical expenses twice. 5"}

Hospital costs The fees charged by your hospital or treatment centre for your medical care whilst you are admitted are known as hospital costs. They include hospital accommodation costs, charges for the use of the operating theatres, charges for radiology and pathology, nursing charges, costs of prosthesis and charges for drugs administered for consumption whilst you are admitted. You can find the level of cover available for your hospital costs in a public hospital, private hospital and high-tech hospital in your Table of Cover (see section entitled “Hospital Cover”). You can check whether your hospital is public, private or high-tech in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Please note that some hospitals may be classed as a high-tech hospital for selected Level 1 plans and a private hospital for all other plans. Treatment centres are classed as private hospitals in terms of your level of cover. Any excess or co-payment specified on your Table of Cover in respect of private hospital cover will not apply to treatment centres but any shortfalls specified will. Medical facilities covered under your plan The medical facilities covered under your plan are shown in your List of Medical Facilities. There are four of these lists but only one will apply to your plan. You can see which one applies to you in your Table of Cover. All the Lists of Medical Facilities are contained in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Where you are admitted to a medical facility covered under your plan and where it is medically necessary, your hospital costs will be fully covered subject to any limitations specified in your Table of Cover, such as excesses (subject to exceptions as outlined under In-patient or Day Case excess section below), shortfalls, co-payments, private rooms covered at semi-private rates etc. Where necessary, we have agreements with medical facilities to ensure that this is the case. However, medical facilities are free to end their arrangement with us at any time so we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case for all the medical facilities covered under your plan throughout your policy year. Where this arrangement between us and a medical facility ends, the medical facility will no longer be covered by us and it will be removed from * We will only cover the costs of visits to practitioners who have appropriate qualifications and registrations. Please see our Directory of Allied Health Professionals, Alternative (Complementary) and Other Practitioners in section 11.1 of this Membership Handbook for details of the qualifications and registrations which each practitioner must hold. ** The provider partners named under these benefits may change from time to time. Access to these benefits is subject to availability and the provider partners’ terms and conditions of use. Our provider partners operate independently from Irish Life Health and we accept no liability for the provision of their services and are not liable for any point of sale or other discounts which may be offered by a provider partner. Provider partner benefits may change or cease during the policy year and such changes are outside of our control. While we aim for nationwide coverage with our benefits, a service may not be available in your locality. Please also note that we are not responsible for the content of the websites of these provider partners. How to calculate your cover under your day-to-day benefits and out-patient benefits The amount that can be claimed under these benefits may be a set amount per visit or it may be a percentage of the cost of the visit up to a maximum amount per visit or per policy year. There may be a limit to the number of times in your policy year that you can claim a refund for a visit to a particular medical practitioner or for a particular service. In addition the number of refunds that you can claim for specified practitioners collectively may be limited (this is known as “combined visits”). Please note that there may be a limit on the total amount that we will pay for Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in a policy year. This limit will apply before the deduction of any applicable policy excess. In addition an excess may apply to the total amount you claim under your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in your policy year.

Medical facilities not covered on your plan We will not cover your hospital costs in a medical facility which is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities. We have made every effort to ensure that all health services that are listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations (“Prescribed Health Services”) are available through at least one of the medical facilities covered in your List of Medical Facilities. In the unlikely event that a Prescribed Health Service is not available in one of those medical facilities, we will cover the Prescribed Health Service in a medical facility that is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities as if it was covered under your plan (i.e. to the level of cover available under your In-patient Benefits). However, you must notify us in advance that you wish to receive such medical services in a medical facility that is not covered under your plan. Please note that we will not cover you if you receive health services (other than emergency care), which are not listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, in a medical facility which is not covered under your plan. We will cover your stay in a public hospital that is not covered under your List of Medical Facilities whilst you are receiving emergency care, provided the public hospital is listed on one of the Lists of Medical Facilities covered by Irish Life Health. You must have been admitted through the accident and emergency department. Any follow on care and/or elective treatments or procedures will only be covered in a medical facility which is covered under your plan. The only exception to this is if our medical advisers agree that you are not medically fit to travel, in which case we will cover your hospital costs in the same public hospital but this will need to be pre-authorised by us. How long are your hospital costs covered for? You can claim hospital costs under your In-patient Benefits for a total of 180 days in a calendar year (the “Maximum Period”). This Maximum Period includes the number of days for which you can claim hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient. The number of days that you can claim as a psychiatric patient is shown in the psychiatric treatment benefits in your Table of Cover. Please note that the Maximum Period includes any days for which you have already claimed hospital costs (including hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient) under another plan with us or with another health insurer in a calendar year. Your health care provider’s fees Consultants Your in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees covers the professional fees of consultants who are registered with Irish Life Health, where they provide you with the treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits. Your consultant’s fees will only be covered where your procedure or treatment is performed in a medical facility covered under your plan. However, there is a small number of treatments and procedures which will be covered when they are performed in your consultant’s room. These are set out in the “non-hospital” section of the Schedule of Benefits. Consultants registered with Irish Life Health We will only cover consultants who are registered with Irish Life Health. Where your consultant is registered with us, the extent to which their professional fees are covered will depend on whether they have chosen to be a participating consultant or standard rate consultant. • Participating consultants Participating consultants have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees for performing the procedures and treatments in the Schedule of Benefits. This means that if your consultant is a participating consultant, you will be fully covered for the procedures and treatments listed in the Schedule of Benefits provided the consultant is operating within the rules imposed by the HSE relating to his capacity to practice privately. • Standard rate consultants Standard rate consultants (or part participating consultants) have not agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees. Only a small portion of the fees of standard rate consultants will be covered for performing the procedures and treatments in the Schedule of Benefits.

The dental/oral surgical procedures that are covered under our In-patient Benefits are listed in the “Periodontal/Oral/Dental Surgery Ground Rules” section of the Schedule of Benefits. These procedures will only be covered where they are performed by the specified type of dental practitioner (i.e. a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist).

Your GP’s fees for a routine visit will be covered under our Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits. The treatments and procedures that will be covered under your In-patient Benefits are set out in the GP section of the Schedule of Benefits. If your treatment or procedure is not listed in the GP section, your GP’s fees will not be covered. As with consultants and dental professionals, your GP must be registered with Irish Life Health before they will be covered and the extent to which their fees are covered will depend on whether they are a participating GP or a standard rate GP. Please see previous sections for a full explanation on the effect of your health care provider not being registered with Irish Life Health and not participating with Irish Life Health. Changes to the status of your health care provider Health care providers are free to alter their arrangement with Irish Life Health at any time. Therefore, by way of example, a participating health care provider may choose to become standard rate or to unregister with us at any time. Any changes to their status with us will affect how they are covered immediately. Therefore the level to which their fees are covered may change throughout your policy year. We recommend that you always check whether your health care provider is registered with Irish Life Health and whether they are participating or standard rate before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility. You can do this by visiting our website or contacting our call centre on 01 562 5100. Maternity treatment In-patient benefits do not apply where you are admitted to a medical facility for the delivery of your baby (except for caesarean section deliveries). Whilst you are admitted for the delivery of your baby, you are a maternity patient and your Maternity Benefits apply. The level of cover available to you for your maternity care is set out in your Maternity Benefits on your Table of Cover. Where your maternity care ends, but you remain admitted for any medically necessary reason, your In- patient Benefits will apply and you will receive the level of cover available under the In-patient Benefits on your Table of Cover.Psychiatric treatment Where you are admitted to a psychiatric medical facility or a psychiatric unit in a medical facility, your hospital costs and consultant’s fees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits at the level shown in the Hospital Cover section of your Table of Cover. Your plan will also include psychiatric treatment benefits. These benefits specify the maximum number of days for which you can claim your In-patient Benefits whilst you are a psychiatric patient for medically necessary treatment. If you are admitted to an approved psychiatric home care programme provided by a private psychiatric medical facility, the number of days claimed will be deducted from the maximum covered under your psychiatric treatment benefits. How In-patient Benefits are claimed In most cases, we’ll pay the amount for which you are covered under your In-patient Benefits directly to your medical facility and health care providers. They claim the amount for which you are covered from Irish Life Health on your behalf and we pay this to them directly. This is known as direct settlement. Please note that only the amount for which you are covered will be directly settled with your medical facility and health care provider. Direct settlement applies to all claims for professional fees for health care providers that are registered with us. We will not directly settle any claims for the amounts shown in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for health care providers that are not registered with us. Your List of Medical Facilities shows the medical facilities that we will pay through direct settlement. Whether direct settlement is available for a particular medical facility may change from time to time. You should always"}

Where direct settlement applies, your medical facility or health care provider will submit your claim form to us on your behalf. It is important to remember that they are only making the claim on your behalf and that you are responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the claim are correct. If your claim form contains any inaccurate information, we may treat your claim as fraudulent, decline the claim and possibly cancel your plan or policy (see section 7 of this Membership Handbook for further information on our fraud policy). You will need to sign your claim form before your medical facility or health care provider submits it to us.

Shortfall In some cases your benefit may not cover all your medical costs and you will need to pay a proportion of such costs yourself. This is known as a shortfall. For instance, if your hospital costs are subject to 90% cover, you will be required to pay the remaining 10% yourself. You can see if a shortfall applies and if so, how much it is, in your Table of Cover.

Where it has been more than 12 months since your last chemotherapy session, your course of treatment will be considered to have ended and the excess will apply again for any further course of treatment. >where you are admitted as a day case patient for the purpose of receiving psychiatric treatment in a medical facility, the day case excess will only apply once for each course of treatment provided all days relevant to that course of treatment are submitted as a single claim. Where it has been more than 3 months since your last admission, your course of treatment will be considered to have ended and the excess will apply again for any further course of treatment. >where your Table of Cover states that an in-patient or day case excess is only payable on a certain number of admissions. >We will not apply the in-patient excess where you are admitted as an in-patient or day case patient for the purpose of receiving radiotherapy treatment. >We will not apply the in-patient excess where you are admitted as an in-patient or day case patient in the treatment centres covered in your List of Medical Facilities.Co-payment for certain procedures A co-payment is a large excess and is an amount that must be paid by you . You will need to make a co-payment for any of the orthopaedic procedures specified in the List of Orthopaedic Procedures Subject to Co-Payment, for any of the cardiac procedures specified in the List of Cardiac Procedures Subject to Co-Payment and/or for any of the ophthalmic procedures specified in the List of Ophthalmic Procedures Subject to Co- Payment where such orthopaedic, cardiac and/or opthalmic procedures are carried out in a high-tech or private hospital. Co-payments may apply in addition to any other shortfall or excess on your plan. This will be displayed on your Table of Cover.

In-patient Maternity Benefits cover your hospital costs and some of your consultant’s fees when you are admitted to a medical facility covered under your plan as a maternity patient for the delivery of your baby. The costs of your pre and post natal care are not covered under your In-patient Maternity Benefits but may be covered under your Out-patient Benefits or Other Benefits. In-patient Maternity Benefits Benefit Description / Criteria Public hospital cover for maternityUnder this benefit we will either: a) Cover your hospital costs for up to 3 nights where you are admitted to a public hospital.

The private or semi private fee imposed by the public hospital is not covered under this benefit but you may be able to claim back some of that fee under our pre/post natal medical expenses benefit if this benefit is available on your plan.; or b) Pay the contribution specified in your Table of Cover towards your hospital costs. The type of cover available to you will depend on your plan and is set out in your Table of Cover. This benefit is only available where you have been admitted to a public hospital covered on your plan to give birth. This benefit is only available for the first three nights of your hospital stay. Where it is medically necessary for you to remain in hospital for more than 3 nights, your fourth and subsequent night’s stay will be covered under your In-patient Benefits so the level of cover available for a public hospital stay under your in-patient benefits will apply. It is important to note that the level of in-patient cover under your in-patient benefits and your maternity benefits may be different. For example, if you have cover for a private room under your maternity benefits but a semi- private room under your in-patient benefits, you will only be covered for a semi–private room for your fourth and subsequent night’s stay. In this case you should ask to be moved to a semi-private room after your third night or you will have to pay the balance. Please note that caesarean section deliveries are covered under your in-patient benefits and not under this benefit. In-patient maternity consultant feesUnder this benefit we will either: >Cover the professional fees of your baby’s paediatrician; >Cover your anaesthetist’s and pathologist’s professional fees; and >Cover your consultant’s professional fees for a routine delivery (procedure 2206) up to the amount set out in the Schedule of Benefits.

Or: >Pay the contribution specified in the Table of Cover towards your consultants’ professional fees. The type of cover available under your plan is set out in your Table of Cover.

How to claim Where the benefit covers a contribution towards the costs of your maternity care, the maximum amount that we will contribute will be set out in your Table of Cover. If your medical expenses exceed this amount, we will pay the maximum contribution to your medical facility or health care provider and you will need to pay them the balance. If your care is provided by an approved medical facility based in Northern Ireland, all claims will be assessed and settled in euro. Irish Life Health will use the foreign exchange rate which applies at the date of the invoice received from the medical facility or at the time of purchase, as appropriate.

Elective Overseas Referrals Our Elective Overseas Referral benefits cover some of the cost of having a surgical procedure performed abroad. We provide two benefits under our Elective Overseas Referral benefits; (A) ‘Elective Procedure Abroad - for procedures that are available in Ireland’ and (B) ‘Elective Procedure Abroad - for procedures that are not available in Ireland’ The table below explains both our ‘Elective Overseas Referral’ benefits but you should check your Table of Cover to see if these benefits are covered under your plan. All elective medical care received abroad must be pre-authorised by Irish Life Health. See the “How to Claim” section of the table below for details of how to have your elective overseas medical care pre-authorised by us. Please note you will only be covered up to the amount pre- authorised by us. Your overseas medical facility and health care providers may charge more than this amount. If they do, you will be responsible for paying the balance. In addition we do not pay overseas medical facilities and health care providers directly. You will need to pay your entire bill to the medical facility and/ or health care providers yourself. You can then claim the pre- authorised amount from us by submitting your receipts. When you submit an Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form to us, our medical advisers will decide whether the surgical procedure you require abroad is available in Ireland. This can require a complex medical assessment of the treatments and procedures you wish to receive abroad and the treatments and procedures available in Ireland to treat your condition. The decision of our medical advisers is final. In addition, their assessment is based entirely on the information you provide in advance of your undergoing your procedure (in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form). The amount pre-authorised by us cannot be reassessed following your treatment regardless of whether the treatment you receive differs from that anticipated in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form or otherwise. If there are any unforeseen medical costs arising in relation to additional medically necessary treatment from the same episode of care, we will cover you for an amount up to the same amount of the costs that would have arisen and for which you would be covered for in Ireland. Please note that the following conditions apply to Elective Overseas Referrals: >The surgical procedure must be performed or treatment must commence within 31 days from when you leave Ireland; >You must have been referred for the surgical procedure abroad by a participating consultant in Ireland or through the International Second Opinion Service benefit, if applicable; >The surgical procedure must be performed before your pre- authorisation expires. Your pre-authorisation will end either six months from when it is granted, or if you change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you cease to be a member of Irish Life Health, whichever is sooner; >The surgical procedure must be medically necessary and our medical advisers must agree that the surgical procedure will result in a reasonably favourable medical prognosis; >The proposed surgical procedure you require abroad must be related to and have the same objective as a procedure or treatment that you are covered for in Ireland; >The surgical procedure or, where the surgical procedure is not available in Ireland, the most similar surgical procedure available in Ireland, must not be controlled by a national register of waiting lists for"}

Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for information on how the professional fees of participating consultants are covered. Our medical advisers will decide the hospital costs and the consultant’s fees that would have been covered if you were admitted to a medical facility in Ireland to undergo the surgical procedure you wish to receive abroad.

Our medical advisers will decide the hospital costs and the consultant’s fees that would be covered if you were admitted to a medical facility in Ireland to undergo a surgical procedure to treat the medical condition/conditions specified in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form. Our medical advisers must believe that the surgical procedure that you wish to undergo abroad is medically proven to be a more effective method of treatment than the treatments and procedures available in Ireland to treat the condition/conditions specified in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form. The decisions of our medical advisers are final. In some cases your benefit may not cover all your medical costs and you will need to pay such costs yourself. The costs of travelling to and from the country in which you wish to receive your surgical procedure will not be covered. How to claim If you wish to claim either of these benefits you must have all your medical care abroad pre-authorised by us.

Part 2 of the Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form must be completed by your GP or Consultant. Where our medical advisers deem it necessary, you may also be required to provide us with additional information including a detailed medical report from your GP or Consultant in Ireland and/or your treating consultant abroad. Irish Life Health will not contribute to the cost of getting a written medical opinion from your GP or Consultant.

As soon as we receive your first premium, you will be covered from your chosen commencement date subject to the terms and conditions of your policy. When you ’ve joined, you will have access to the secure membership area of our website where you can make changes to your cover and to your personal details. We may contact you by post, email, phone, SMS and through your Irish Life Health secure member area.

Please see section 8 for further details on group schemes.

If you add your newborn in the policy year following their birth, a premium will be payable. The newborn must be added within 13 weeks of the date of birth or waiting periods will apply. Changing your policy The policyholder can make changes to their policy or any of the plans listed on their policy at any time by logging onto the membership area on our website (www.irishlifehealth. ie/members/manage-my-plan) or by contacting us (or their broker) directly.

Please be aware that an upgrade waiting period may apply where there is an upgrade in cover (please see section 6 for further details on upgrade waiting periods). We cannot take instructions to make changes to the policy or any of the plans listed on the policy from a member or individual who is not the policyholder. However, the policyholder can nominate a person to act on their behalf to discuss the policy, administer the policy and / or discuss claims. If you wish to nominate someone, please log on to your membership portal where you can capture policy permissions. Alternatively, you can call or write to us and let us know if you want to nominate a person to act on your behalf for some or all of the above permissions.

Renewing your plan To renew your membership: >If you pay in monthly instalments by direct debit, simply continue to make your direct debit payments. We will automatically renew your policy. >If you pay your annual premium in advance by credit card, please contact us to arrange payment and renew your policy (see section 10 of this Membership Handbook for our contact details).Where your premium is collected by monthly direct debit via your broker, your monthly direct debit will automatically roll over at your next renewal date. If you wish to amend this, change your bank details, or change your method of payment to an annual payment, please contact your broker directly. Cancelling your policy Your policy or any of the plans listed on your policy may be cancelled before the end of your policy year for one of three reasons: 1) You no longer want health insurance with Irish Life Health The policyholder can choose to cancel the policy or any of the plans listed on the policy at any time. To do this, they just need to call our customer services team or let us know in writing. We will refund any amount due on cancellation to the policyholder. In the case of a policyholder who has passed away, we will issue a refund by cheque to the deceased’s estate. If we’re asked to remove a member from the policy, we reserve the right to tell them that they are no longer covered, however, please note that it is not our policy to do so.

Consequences of cancellation Once a plan is cancelled, the member will no longer be covered. We will not pay any claims for goods or services received after the Cancellation Date. We will be entitled to recover any claim amount paid for in-patient care or goods or services received after the Cancellation Date. The Out-patient Benefits and Day- to-day Benefits will be allocated on a pro-rata basis.

The yearly excess applicable to those benefits will not be reduced on a pro-rata basis. If a fully paid policy or plan is cancelled before the end of the policy year, we will reimburse the policyholder for the cover the member(s) have not received – i.e. from the Cancellation Date until the next renewal date. Please note we will apply a mid-term cancellation charge (you can find more information about this charge in the paragraph below).

Mid-term cancellation charge We will apply a mid-term cancellation charge if: >you choose to cancel your policy or any of the plans listed in your policy before the end of your policy year; >we are forced to cancel your policy or any of the plans listed in your policy due to non-payment of premium, because you or any of the members on the policy try to claim when you’re/they’re not entitled to or because you have provided us with incorrect information. The mid-term cancellation charge is made up as follows: >An administration fee of €25; >The portion of the government levy which has not yet been paid by you . The government levy is a stamp duty which is payable on health insurance plans. A full explanation of the government levy is contained in the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook. We reserve the right to deduct the amount for the mid-term cancellation charge against any amount due to be refunded. In all other cases we will send you an invoice in respect of the mid- term cancellation charge. A mid-term cancellation charge also applies to policies paid by direct debit. Cooling Off You can cancel your policy free of charge within 14 working days from the date the policy was entered into or from the date you are given the policy documentation, whichever is the later. This is known as the cooling off period. We’ll give you a full refund of premium unless you or any member has made a claim during this period. If a claim has been made and you wish to cancel your policy from the start date, the cost of any out-patient claim will be deducted from the refund due and you will be liable for any charge relating to in-patient care. Should you wish to cancel your policy with effect from a date later than the start date, we will charge you for providing health insurance cover up to the date of cancellation and we will apply a mid-term cancellation charge in this case. Paying your premiums All premiums must be paid in euro. We have a number of payment options which are outlined below. You can pay your premium monthly by direct debit or annually, in full, by debit or credit card only. We do not accept payment by cheque. If you have chosen to pay by direct debit, we will collect your premium on a monthly basis and it’s up to you to make sure your monthly payments are available for collection. The first payment in any policy year may be more or less than your monthly premium if your policy start date is different to your chosen direct debit collection date. This may also occur if you decide to change your direct debit collection date mid policy year. Where your premium is collected by your broker, your monthly direct debit will automatically roll over at your next renewal date. If you wish to change your bank details or change to an annual payment, please contact your broker directly. 38"}

We do regular audits of all claims across Irish Life Health policies held by you as you may not gain financially from a contract of insurance. In all instances where fraud is suspected, we will carry out a full and comprehensive investigation. If a claim submitted by you or on your behalf is found to be fraudulent or dishonest in any way, the claim will be declined in its entirety, benefits under the policy will be forfeited and the policy and/ or any plans listed on the policy may be cancelled and we may refuse any new policies for you . We reserve the right to refer the matter and details of the fraudulent claim to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 8 Group Schemes If your plan was started as part of a group scheme arrangement and the group scheme sponsor is acting on your behalf, you agree that the group scheme sponsor will have the following powers and responsibilities for the policy: >The group scheme sponsor may instruct us to start and cancel the policy; >The group scheme sponsor may instruct us to change your plan or level of cover; >The group scheme sponsor may instruct us to add or reduce the number of members on the policy; >The group scheme sponsor may amend or cancel any or all of the plans listed under the policy; >The group scheme sponsor must ensure that all premiums are paid on time as unpaid premiums may impact whether claims are paid; >The group scheme sponsor must ensure that all adequate consents from members are obtained prior to the policy entering into force, including consents from members for the processing of their personal data. Members who are part of a group scheme arrangement may require the permission of the group scheme sponsor to amend their cover. In such circumstances, the members may be required to pay additional premium for such amended cover. If you join a group scheme after the scheme start or renewal date, your benefit entitlement may be adjusted on a pro-rata basis. We will share information with the group scheme sponsor to the extent that is required in order to administer the group scheme. If your employer pays for your plan as part of an employer scheme and your policy is cancelled, we will notify your employer that the policy has been cancelled. We also share aggregate insights with group scheme sponsors (and their financial advisers or brokers) in relation to levels of participation, usage of benefits and claim categories. Aggregate reports are used for insights where individuals are not identifiable. If your policy was arranged through a group scheme sponsor, your cover will continue as long as you fulfil the conditions for participation in the group scheme and the group scheme sponsor continues to pay your premium. 9 Premium Changes We may change the premium payable for our plans from time to time. These changes will not affect you until your next renewal date unless you change your plan during your policy year. Please note that we deduct your tax relief from your premium so you don’t have to claim it back from the Revenue Commissioners. The level of tax relief is set by the Government and may be changed at any time which is outside our control. We are legally obliged to apply tax changes immediately and this may result in a change to the amount that you are required to pay to us for the plans listed in your policy. 43"}

However, the terms and conditions of this contract will apply to all plans and all claims made under the policy. Therefore, where we refer to ‘you’ and ‘your’ throughout this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to members of group schemes. If you are a member of a group scheme where your employer has arranged your cover and is paying all or part of your premium, the Group Schemes section in this Membership Handbook will also apply to you. You must ensure that the information that is provided to us when you are taking out a policy (whether in an application form or otherwise) is accurate and complete (even where the information is being provided to us by someone on your behalf). Otherwise, it could mean we won’t pay a claim under the policy and some or all of the members’ plans under the policy may be cancelled. This may also cause difficulty should you wish to purchase health insurance elsewhere. Understanding your cover Health insurance cover can be difficult to understand so to help you check your cover we have set out a checklist below. We understand that it may be difficult for you to figure out whether you are covered yourself so if you’re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we ’ll walk you through it. In fact, we would always advise you to check your cover with us before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility. When checking your cover with us, you will need to tell us where you intend to have the procedure or treatment performed, the name of your health care provider and the procedure/treatment code. You can get this information from your health care provider. The checklists below explain what to look for to see if you are covered under your Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits. You will notice that some of your benefits will be classed as Maternity Benefits or Other Benefits on your Table of Cover. Some of these benefits are claimed as Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits and the checklists below will apply to these.Day-To-Day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits What to look for Where to check >Is the benefit covered under your plan? >How much will we pay? >Is there an excess?Your Table of Cover >What terms and conditions apply to the benefit? >Does a waiting period apply? >How can you claim?Your Membership Handbook >What does the benefit cover? >Are there any further criteria?The Lists (if applicable) In-Patient Benefits What to look for Where to check >Is the treatment or procedure an established treatment? >Is the treatment or procedure medically necessary? >Is your health care provider registered with Irish Life Health and a participating health care provider? >Will you be admitted to a medical facility and if so, which one? >If not, where will you be having your procedure or treatment performed?Your health care provider >Is your treatment or procedure covered (is it listed in the Schedule of Benefits)? >Do any clinical indicators apply and do you meet them? >Does your treatment or procedure need to be pre-authorised? >Is your treatment or procedure covered when it is carried out by the type of health care provider you are attending (i.e. is it covered when carried out by a GP , dentist, oral surgeon, periodontist)? >If your treatment or procedure is not going to be performed in a hospital or treatment centre, is it covered when it is carried out in your health care provider’s rooms?The Schedule of Benefits or your health care provider >Which List of Medical Facilities applies to you ? >What’s your level of cover? i.e. Do you need to pay an excess, shortfall or co-payment?Table of Cover >If you are being admitted to a medical facility, is it included in the List of Medical Facilities covered under your plan? >Does a waiting period apply? >How can you claim? >Are there"}

They also show if we pay them directly (known as direct settlement) or if you need to pay them yourself and claim this back from us. You will be covered for the medical facilities specified in one of four lists shown in the tables (your “List of Medical Facilities”). Your Table of Cover shows which List of Medical Facilities applies to you. Table of Cover Your Table of Cover sets out the benefits that are available under your plan. The Schedule of Benefits The Schedule of Benefits is sectioned by specialty and sets out the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these need to be pre-authorised. It shows the clinical indicators that must be present in order for a procedure or treatment to be covered. It also specifies that certain treatments and procedures will only be covered if they are performed by a certain type of health care provider or if they are performed in a certain place (i.e. in a hospital). The GP section sets out the procedures and treatments that we will cover when they are carried out by your GP in their surgery. It also shows which of these procedures and treatments require pre-authorisation and sets out any clinical indicators that apply. These documents contain medical language which is really designed to be read by doctors and consultants. For this reason, we would advise you to contact us or your health care provider before undergoing your procedure or treatment to confirm whether it will be covered by us. The Schedule of Benefits can be accessed on our website at Irishlifehealth.ie or a hard copy can be requested from us. The Lists These Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and in some cases contain criteria which must be satisfied before the benefit will apply. We will let you know throughout this Membership Handbook or in your Table of Cover when it is necessary to refer to a List in connection with a benefit. The Lists are available on our website www.irishlifehealth.ie/privacy-and- legal/schedule-of-benefits. The following is a brief explanation of each of the Lists: 1. The List of Special Procedures This confirms which procedures are covered under the Listed Special Procedures benefit. See section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further information on this benefit.2. The List of Cardiac Procedures This confirms which procedures are covered under the Listed Cardiac Procedures benefit. See section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further information on this benefit. 3. The List of Medical and Surgical Appliances This list confirms the medical and surgical appliances for which you can claim a contribution from us under the medical and surgical appliances benefit. It also sets out the contribution that can be claimed for each appliance. 4. The List of Orthopaedic Procedures Subject to Co-Payment This list specifies the orthopaedic procedures where a co- payment applies when such procedures are carried out in a private or high-tech hospital. 5. The List of Cardiac Procedures Subject to Co-Payment This list specifies the cardiac procedures where a co-payment applies when such procedures are carried out in a private or high-tech hospital. 6. The List of Clinical Indicators for Cardiac MRI and Cardiac CT Scans This list sets out the clinical indicators that must be satisfied for cardiac MRI and cardiac CT scans. 7. The List of Post Operative Home Help (POHH) Procedures The post-operative home help benefit is only available following certain procedures. These are set out in the List of Post-Operative Home Help (POHH) Procedures. 8. The List of Gender Affirmation Procedures This list confirms which procedures are covered under the gender affirmation benefit. 9. List of Provider Partners This list confirms the provider partners for which you can claim a benefit, discount from or contribution from us under certain benefits. 10. The List of Ophthalmic Procedures Subject to Co-Payment This list specifies the ophthalmic procedures where a co- payment applies when such procedures are carried out in a private or high-tech hospital. 11. The List of Care Connect health programmes This list confirms the health programmes available under the Care Connect benefit.

Clinical Indicators In some cases medical criteria known as clinical indicators need to be satisfied before our medical advisers will consider the treatment or procedure to be medically necessary. If clinical indicators apply, they will be set out alongside the procedure or treatment in the Schedule of Benefits or in the List of Clinical Indicators for Cardiac MRI and Cardiac CT Scans."}
{"chunk_id": 108, "plan_name": "tailored_health_plans_membership_handbook_terms_conditions", "document_type": "membership_handbook", "page_number": 5, "chunk_text": "4Pre-authorisation Certain procedures and treatments are not covered unless they are approved in advance by us. Approval is only given where the procedure or treatment meets specific clinical indicators or we determine that it will result in a reasonably favourable medical prognosis. If your treatment or procedure needs to be pre- authorised, this will be specified in the Schedule of Benefits. To apply for pre-authorisation, your health care provider must submit a request in writing to Irish Life Health in order for your claim to be considered. We will assess your request as soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days. The treatment must begin, or surgical procedure must be performed, before your pre-authorisation expires. Your pre- authorisation will end either six months from when it is granted, or if you change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you cease to be a member of Irish Life Health, whichever is sooner. Your health care provider In most cases your treatment or procedure will be carried out by your consultant but there are some treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by your GP , dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. The professional fees of health professionals can be covered as an In-patient Benefit, an Out-patient Benefit or a Day-to-day Benefit depending on type of care you receive. Generally when you receive a procedure or treatment that is listed in the Schedule of Benefits, your health care provider’s fees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits. We fully cover health care providers who are registered with us and have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their professional fees (i.e. a participating health care provider). You will have to pay most, or all, of your health care provider’s fees yourself if they are not registered with us or are not participating. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for a full explanation about how your health care provider’s professional fees are covered under your In-patient Benefits. Generally an out-patient consultation with a consultant or a visit to your GP or dentist will be covered as a Day-to-day Benefit or an Out-patient Benefit. In these circumstances it doesn’t matter if your consultant/GP/dentist is registered with Irish Life Health or is participating. Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits usually allow you to claim a contribution from us towards a certain number of visits to your consultant/GP/dentist in your policy year. If these benefits are available under your plan, the amount you can claim back per visit and the number of visits for which you can claim will be shown in your Table of Cover. Waiting periods Your medical expenses will not be covered until after your waiting periods have expired. Waiting periods are explained in section 6 of this Membership Handbook. Excess/Shortfall/Co-payment You will need to pay any excess, shortfall or co-payment that applies to a benefit or a group of benefits under your plan. You can’t claim these expenses back from us. You can see if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies by checking your Table of Cover. See sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for more information on excesses, shortfalls and co-payments.Understanding changes to your cover 1. Changes to your plan on renewal From time to time we alter the benefits available under our plans. If we alter the plan that you are on, the benefit changes will not affect you during your policy year but will apply if you purchase that plan at your next renewal.Therefore, it is important to remember that where you renew on the same plan the benefits may not be the same as they were in your previous policy year. 2. Changes to your cover throughout your policy year In some cases, the cover that is available under your plan may change throughout your policy year for the following reasons: Changes to the Schedule of Benefits We review and where necessary amend the Schedule of Benefits regularly to update the procedures and treatments that are covered by us and the clinical indicators conditions of payment and/or payment indicators that apply to procedures and treatments. These changes may become effective during your policy year. You can find the most current versions of these on our website or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover. Changes to the List of Medical Facilities We may add medical facilities to the List of Medical Facilities from time to time. We may also need to remove medical facilities from the List of Medical Facilities if our arrangement with those medical facilities ends. The medical facilities which will be paid directly by us may also change from time to time. See section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further details. You can find"}

You can find the most current versions of these on our website or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover. Changes to the status of health care provider Your health care provider’s status with us (i.e. whether they are registered and are a participating health care provider) may change from time to time. This means that the amount of their professional fees that we will cover may change throughout your policy year. You can check whether your health care provider is registered with Irish Life Health and whether they are a participating health care provider by contacting us on 01 562 5100.

You can do this yourself by checking the most up to date information on our website or you can call us and we will check this for you .Acknowledgment By entering this policy you are acknowledging that you have read this Membership Handbook and understand your cover. In particular, you are confirming that you understand the contractual documents that make up your contract with us and that your cover may change throughout your policy year. 2 Your Cover & How to Claim The benefits available under your plan are shown in your Table of Cover. They are divided into different sections mainly due to how they are claimed or the type of expenses covered. The following sections of this Membership Handbook explain the different types of benefits offered by us. Within each section is a table which lists our benefits, shows the terms and conditions that apply to each benefit, and tells you how to claim it. Please note that all these benefits may not be available under your plan. You should check your Table of Cover to see which benefits apply to you and how much you can claim under each benefit. You will also be able to see on your Table of Cover if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies. How our benefits are categorised can change on different plans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear in different sections in this Membership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is not explained in the corresponding table in this Membership Handbook, please check the tables in other sections of this Membership Handbook. The terms and conditions that apply to our benefits (as described in the tables below) will always apply even if the benefit is positioned in a different section of your Table of Cover. If a day-to-day excess or an out-patient excess applies to your plan, this will apply per policy year and will always affect all the benefits included in those sections of your Table of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one or more of your Day- to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits appear in a different section in this Membership Handbook. You will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for the medical services listed in those regulations (subject to any waiting periods). Please see section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook for an explanation of the Minimum Benefit Regulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or other deductions required by law before paying your claim."}

It may be a set amount per visit or it may be a percentage of the cost of the visit up to a maximum amount per visit or per policy year. There may be a limit to the number of times in your policy year that you can claim a refund for a visit to a particular medical practitioner or for a particular service. In some cases the benefit is only available for a specific provider partner. Where this is the case, the provider partner will be named in the tables above. In addition, the number of refunds that you can claim for specified practitioners collectively may be limited (this is known as “combined visits”). Please note that there may be a limit on the total amount that we will pay for Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in a policy year. This limit will apply before the deduction of any applicable policy excess. In addition, an excess may apply to the total amount you claim under your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in your policy year. So for example, where an excess applies to the Out- patient Benefits under your plan, it applies to the total amount you are claiming for all your Out-patient Benefits in your policy year. When you submit your receipts to us we will calculate the total amount due to be refunded to you under all your Out- patient Benefits, subtract the excess and refund you the balance.For example: Example 1 Example 2 Cover shown on Table of Cover€60 x 2 consultant visits75% x 5 consultant visits Number of times you visited your consultant in your policy year and how much you paid per visit2 x €100 5 x €100 Total amount that you can claim (the number of times you visited a consultant multiplied by the maximum amount that can be claimed per visit)2 x €60 = €120 5 x €75 = €375 Less out-patient excess €150 €200 Money we pay you back €0 €175 How to claim If your scan is carried out in an approved centre (i.e. a scan facility that is covered in the appropriate table for your scan type in your List of Medical Facilities), we will pay the scan facility directly. If your scan is carried out in a non-approved centre (i.e. a scan facility that is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities) you will have to pay for your scan yourself and claim the amount that is covered back from us, if cover for non-approved centres is included in your plan during or at the end of your policy year by scanning your original receipts and submitting them through our online claims tool (Irish Life Health Online Claiming) in your member area on www.irishlifehealth.ie. You must submit your receipts within six months of the end of your policy year. If your receipts are not received within these six months, your claim will not be paid. You should keep your original receipts for your own records and in case we request them to be resubmitted.

Hospital costs The fees charged by your hospital or treatment centre for your medical care whilst you are admitted are known as hospital costs. They include hospital accommodation costs, charges for the use of the operating theatres, charges for radiology and pathology, nursing charges, costs of prosthesis and charges for drugs administered for consumption whilst you are admitted. You can find the level of cover available for your hospital costs in a public hospital, private hospital and high-tech hospital in your Table of Cover (see section entitled “Hospital Cover”). You can check whether your hospital is public, private or high-tech in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Treatment centres are classed as private hospitals in terms of your level of cover. Any excess or co-payment specified on your Table of Cover in respect of private hospital cover will not apply to treatment centres but any shortfalls specified will. Medical facilities covered under your plan The medical facilities covered under your plan are shown in your List of Medical Facilities. There are four of these lists but only one will apply to your plan. You can see which one applies to you in your Table of Cover. The Lists of Medical Facilities are contained in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Where you are admitted to a medical facility covered under your plan, and where it is medically necessary, your hospital costs will be fully covered subject to any limitations specified in your Table of Cover, such as excesses, (subject to exceptions as outlined under In-patient or Day Case excess section below), shortfalls, co-payments, private rooms covered at semi-private rates, etc. Where necessary, we have agreements with medical facilities to ensure that this is the case. However, medical facilities are free to end their arrangement with us at any time so we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case for all the medical facilities covered under your plan throughout your policy year. Where this arrangement between us and a medical facility ends, the medical facility will no longer be covered by us and it will be removed from all the Lists of Medical Facilities. Similarly, where we enter into new arrangements with medical facilities, they will be added to one or more of the Lists of Medical Facilities. Such changes will affect your plan immediately. Up-to-date Lists of Medical Facilities are available on our website at Irishlifehealth. ie. We recommend that you always check whether your medical facility is covered before being admitted by reviewing your List of Medical Facilities on our website or contacting our call centre on 01 562 5100. Medical facilities not covered on your plan We will not cover your hospital costs in a medical facility which is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities.We have made every effort to ensure that all health services that are listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations (“Prescribed Health Services”) are available through at least one of the medical facilities covered in your List of Medical Facilities. In the unlikely event that a Prescribed Health Service is not available in one of those medical facilities, we will cover the Prescribed Health Service in a medical facility that is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities as if it was covered under your plan (i.e. to the level of cover available under your In-patient Benefits). However, you must notify us in advance that you wish to receive such medical services in a medical facility that is not covered under your plan. Please note that we will not cover you if you receive health services (other than emergency care), which are not listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, in a medical facility which is not covered under your plan. We will cover your stay in a public hospital that is not covered under your List of Medical Facilities whilst you are receiving emergency care, provided the public hospital is listed on one of the Lists of Medical Facilities covered by Irish Life Health. You must have been admitted through the accident and emergency department. Any follow on care and/or elective treatments or procedures will only be covered in a medical facility which is covered under your plan. The only exception to this is if our medical advisers agree that you are not medically fit to travel, in which case we will cover your hospital costs in the same public hospital but this will need to be pre-authorised by us.

You can claim hospital costs under your In-patient Benefits for a total of 180 days in a calendar year (the “Maximum Period”). This Maximum Period includes the number of days for which you can claim hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient. The number of days that you can claim as a psychiatric patient is shown in the psychiatric treatment benefits in your Table of Cover. Please note that the Maximum Period includes any days for which you have already claimed hospital costs (including hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient) under another plan with us or with another health insurer in a calendar year. Your health care provider’s fees Consultants Your in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees covers the professional fees of consultants who are registered with Irish Life Health, where they provide you with the treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits. Your consultant’s fees will only be covered where your procedure or treatment is performed in a medical facility covered under your plan. However, there is a small number of treatments and procedures which will be covered when they are performed in your consultant’s room. These are set out in the “non-hospital” section of the Schedule of Benefits. Consultants registered with Irish Life Health We will only cover consultants who are registered with Irish Life Health. Where your consultant is registered with us, the extent to which their professional fees are covered will depend on whether they have chosen to be a participating consultant or standard rate consultant. • Participating consultants"}

This means that if your consultant is a participating consultant, you will be fully covered for the procedures and treatments listed in the Schedule of Benefits provided the consultant is operating within the rules imposed by the HSE relating to his capacity to practice privately. • Standard rate consultants Standard rate consultants (or part participating consultants) have not agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees. Only a small portion of the fees of standard rate consultants will be covered for performing the procedures and treatments in the Schedule of Benefits. Therefore, if your consultant is a standard rate consultant you will have to pay a large portion of their fees yourself. You will not be able to claim this back from us. Consultants not registered with Irish Life Health Where your consultant is not registered with Irish Life Health we will not cover their professional fees. The only exception to this is if your consultant’s fees for performing your treatment or procedure are included in the Minimum Benefit Regulations. If they are, you can claim the amount set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations back from us at the end of your policy year. It’s important you know your consultant’s fees are likely to be a lot more than the amount shown in the Minimum Benefit Regulations. If this happens, you ’ll have to pay the difference. Dentists/Oral surgeons/Periodontists Your in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees also covers a limited number of dental/oral surgical procedures where they are performed by a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. (This excludes dentist visits and emergency dental care which are covered under our Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits). The dental/oral surgical procedures that are covered under our In-patient Benefits are listed in the “Periodontal/Oral/Dental Surgery Ground Rules” section of the Schedule of Benefits. These procedures will only be covered where they are performed by the specified type of dental practitioner (i.e. a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist). Please note many dental/oral surgical procedures require pre-authorisation. Your dentist/oral surgeon/periodontist’s fees will only be covered where your oral/dental surgery is performed in a medical facility covered under your plan or in your dentist/oral surgeon/periodontist’s room. As with your consultant, your dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist must be registered with Irish Life Health. If they are not registered with us, you will not be covered (subject to cover prescribed under the Minimum Benefit Regulations, if applicable). The extent to which your oral surgeon/ periodontist’s professional fees are covered will also depend on whether they have chosen to be a participating or a standard rate oral surgeon/periodontist. See the consultant section above for a full explanation on how your oral health care provider’s status as participating or standard rate affects your cover. Please note that all dentists are classed as standard rate so we will only cover a limited portion of your dentist’s fees for performing oral/ dental surgery. GPs We will cover your GP’s fees for performing a limited number of treatments and procedures in their surgery. Such procedures and treatments are covered under your in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees. Your GP’s fees for a routine visit will be covered under our Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits. The treatments and procedures that will be covered under your In- patient Benefits are set out in the GP section. If your treatment or procedure is not listed in the GP section, your GP’s fees will not be covered. As with consultants and dental professionals, your GP must be registered with Irish Life Health before they will be covered and the extent to which their fees are covered will depend on whether they are a participating GP or a standard rate GP. Please see previous sections for a full explanation on the effect of your health care provider not being registered with Irish Life Health and not participating with Irish Life Health. Changes to the status of your health care provider Health care providers are free to alter their arrangement with Irish Life Health at any time. Therefore, by way of example, a participating health care provider may choose to become standard rate or to unregister with us at any time. Any changes to their status with us will affect how they are covered immediately. Therefore, the level to which their fees are covered may change throughout your policy year. We recommend that you always check whether your health care provider is registered with Irish Life Health and whether they are participating or standard rate before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility.

The level of cover available to you for your maternity care is set out in your Maternity Benefits on your Table of Cover.

This is known as direct settlement. Please note that only the amount for which you are covered will be directly settled with your medical facility and health care provider. Direct settlement applies to all claims for professional fees for health care providers that are registered with us. We will not directly settle any claims for the amounts shown in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for health care providers that are not registered with us. Your List of Medical Facilities shows the medical facilities that we will pay through direct settlement. Whether direct settlement is available for a particular medical facility may change from time to time. You should always check the most up to date List of Medical Facilities before being admitted to any medical facility to see whether direct settlement applies or whether you will have to pay the medical facility and claim it back from us. Where direct settlement applies, your medical facility or health care provider will submit your claim form to us on your behalf. It is important to remember that they are only making the claim on your behalf and that you are responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the claim are correct. If your claim form contains any inaccurate information, we may treat your claim as fraudulent, decline the claim and possibly cancel your plan or policy (see section 7 of this Membership Handbook for further information on our fraud policy). You will need to sign your claim form before your medical facility or health care provider submits it to us. Your medical facility and health care providers should always specify the medical care you received on your claim form before you are asked to sign it. You should check this information very carefully to ensure that it is accurate. By signing this form you are confirming that you have received the medical care specified in the form and that all information contained in your claim form is true and accurate. When we’ve paid your claims, we’ll send you a statement confirming payment and outlining the amounts paid on your behalf. Where direct settlement is not available, you will have to pay your medical facility and your health care provider yourself and claim the amount that is covered back from us. You will need to submit a claim form to us specifying the medical care you received which is signed by all relevant health care providers and your medical facility together with all your receipts. Your medical facility and health care providers will be able to provide these for you. The completed claim form and receipts should be sent to our claims team (see section 10 of this Membership Handbook).

This is known as a shortfall. For instance, if your hospital costs are subject to 90% cover, you will be required to pay the remaining 10% yourself. You can see if a shortfall applies and if so, how much it is, in your Table of Cover. In-patient or day case excess In some cases you may be required to pay an amount of your bill before your cover begins. This is known as an excess.

In-patient Maternity Benefits cover your hospital costs and some of your consultant’s fees when you are admitted to a medical facility covered under your plan as a maternity patient for the delivery of your baby. The costs of your pre and post-natal care are not covered under your In-patient Maternity Benefits but may be covered under your Out-patient Benefits or Enhanced Protection & Maternity Personalised Packages. In-patient Maternity Benefits Benefit Description / Criteria Public hospital cover for maternityUnder this benefit we will either: a) cover your in-patient hospital costs for 3 nights where you are admitted to a public hospital to give birth. (Please note that you will only be able to avail of a private room or semi-private room where you have opted to be treated privately or semi-privately by a consultant for your pre and post-natal care. The consultant’s booking fee is not covered under this benefit but you may be able to claim back some of that fee under our “Out-patient maternity consultant fees” benefit or our pre/post-natal maternity costs benefit if these are available on your plan); or b) pay the contribution specified in your Table of Cover towards your in-patient hospital costs. The type of cover available to you will depend on your plan and is set out in your Table of Cover. This benefit is only available where you have been admitted to a public hospital covered on your plan to give birth. This benefit is only available for the first three nights of your hospital stay. Where it is medically necessary for you to remain in hospital for more than 3 nights, your fourth and subsequent night’s stay will be covered under your In-patient Benefits so the level of cover available for a public hospital stay under your in-patient benefits will apply. It is important to note that the level of in-patient cover under your in-patient benefits and your maternity benefits may be different. For example, if you have cover for a private room under your maternity benefits but a semi- private room under your in-patient benefits, you will only be covered for a semi–private room for your fourth and subsequent night’s stay. In this case you should ask to be moved to a semi-private room after your third night or you will have to pay the balance. Please note that caesarean section deliveries are covered under your In-patient Benefits and not under this benefit. In-patient maternity consultant feesUnder this benefit we will either: >Cover the professional fees of your baby’s paediatrician; >Cover your anaesthetist’s and pathologist’s professional fees; and >Cover your consultant’s professional fees. Or: >Pay the contribution specified in the Table of Cover towards your consultants’ professional fees. The type of cover available under your plan is set out in your Table of Cover. Please note that where you are attending a public hospital this benefit is only available where you have opted to be treated privately or semi-privately by a consultant for your pre and post-natal care. How to claim Where the benefit covers a contribution towards the costs of your maternity care, the maximum amount that we will contribute will be set out in your Table of Cover. If your medical expenses exceed this amount, we will pay the maximum contribution to your medical facility or health care provider and you will need to pay them the balance. If your care is provided by an approved medical facility based in Northern Ireland, all claims will be assessed and settled in euro.

In addition, their assessment is based entirely on the information you provide in advance of your undergoing your procedure (in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form).

As soon as we receive your first premium, you will be covered from your chosen commencement date subject to the terms and conditions of your policy. When you’ve joined, you will have access to the secure member area of our website where you can make changes to your cover and to your personal details. We may contact you by post, email, phone, SMS and through your Irish Life Health secure member area. Please note that if you are a group scheme member you may not be able to make changes to your plan via the secure member area of our website. Please see section 8 for further details on group schemes. You may add your newborn to your policy from their date of birth and no additional premium will be charged for their cover up to the first renewal date after their birth. If you add your newborn in the policy year following their birth, a premium will be payable. The newborn must be added within 13 weeks of the date of his/her birth or waiting periods will apply. Changing your policy The policyholder can make changes to their policy or any of the plans listed on their policy at any time by logging onto the membership area on our website (www.irishlifehealth.ie/secure/ ie/login) or by contacting us (or their broker) directly. Changes can affect the premium that is payable. If a change is made to the policy, we will issue new policy documents to the policyholder as soon as the change is completed. Please be aware that an upgrade waiting period may apply where there is an upgrade in cover (please see section 6 for further details on upgrade waiting periods). We cannot take instructions to make changes to the policy or any of the plans listed on the policy from a member or individual who is not the policyholder. However, the policyholder can nominate a person to act on their behalf to discuss the policy, administer the policy and / or discuss claims. If you wish to nominate someone, please log on to your membership portal where you can capture policy permissions. Alternatively, you can call or write to us and let us know if you want to nominate a person to act on your behalf for some or all of the above permissions. Where a plan is altered prior to the end of the policy year, the Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits and Personalised Packages Benefits will will be applied on a pro-rata basis. Renewing your plan To renew your membership: >If you pay in monthly installments by direct debit, simply continue to make your direct debit payments. We will automatically renew your policy. >If you pay your annual premium in advance by credit card, please contact us to arrange payment and renew your policy (see section 10 of this Membership Handbook for our contact details). Where your premium is collected by monthly direct debit via your broker, your monthly direct debit will automatically roll over at your next renewal date. If you wish to amend this, change your bank details, or change your method of payment to an annual payment, please contact your broker directly. Cancelling your policy Your policy or any of the plans listed on your policy may be cancelled before the end of your policy year for one of three reasons: 1) You no longer want health insurance with Irish Life Health The policyholder can choose to cancel the policy or any of the plans listed on the policy at any time. To do this, they just need to call our customer services team or let us know in writing. We will refund any amount due on cancellation to the policyholder. In the case of a policyholder who has passed away, we will issue a refund by cheque to the deceased’s estate. If we’re asked to remove a member from the policy, we reserve"}

It is the policyholder’s responsibility to inform the members on their policy of any changes that affect their cover. 2) Premiums are not kept up to date We will cancel the policy or any of the plans listed on your policy if you do not pay your premium when it falls due. We will cancel the policy or any of the plans listed on the policy from the date that your premiums were paid up to (the Cancellation Date). We will not pay any claims for goods or services received after the Cancellation Date. We will send you a letter or email giving you 14 days’ notice of our intention to cancel.

The Out-patient Benefits, Day-to-day Benefits and Personalised Packages Benefits will be allocated on a pro-rata basis. (e.g. where the GP visits benefit covers a contribution of up to €30 for up to 8 visits and the plan is cancelled after 6 months, the number of visits for which the member can claim will be reduced to 4). The yearly excess applicable to those benefits will not be reduced on a pro-rata basis. If a fully paid policy or plan is cancelled before the end of the policy year, we will reimburse the policyholder for the cover the member(s) have not received – i.e. from the Cancellation Date until the next renewal date. Please note we will apply a mid-term cancellation charge (you can find more information about this charge in the paragraph below). We will not return the amount of premium for any cover received before the date of cancellation. If we cancel a fully paid policy or plan before the end of the policy year due to the submission of a fraudulent or dishonest claim, we will not refund any of the premium that has already been paid. Mid-term cancellation charge We will apply a mid-term cancellation charge if: >you choose to cancel your policy or any of the plans listed in your policy before the end of your policy year; >we are forced to cancel your policy or any of the plans listed in your policy due to non-payment of premium, because you or any of the members on the policy try to claim when you’re/they’re not entitled to or because you have provided us with incorrect information. The mid-term cancellation charge is made up as follows: >An administration fee of €25; >The portion of the government levy which has not yet been paid by you . The government levy is a stamp duty which is payable on health insurance plans. A full explanation of the government levy is contained in the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook. We reserve the right to deduct the amount for the mid-term cancellation charge against any amount due to be refunded. In all other cases we will send you an invoice in respect of the mid- term cancellation charge. A mid-term cancellation charge also applies to policies paid by direct debit. Cooling Off You can cancel your policy free of charge within 14 working days from the date the policy was entered into or from the date you are given the policy documentation, whichever is the later. This is known as the cooling off period. We’ll give you a full refund of premium unless you or any member has made a claim during this period. If a claim has been made and you wish to cancel your policy from the start date, the cost of any out-patient claim will be deducted from the refund due and you will be liable for any charge relating to in-patient care. Should you wish to cancel your policy with effect from a date later than the start date, we will charge you for providing health insurance cover up to the date of cancellation and we will apply a mid-term cancellation charge in this case.Paying your premiums All premiums must be paid in euro. We have a number of payment options which are outlined below. You can pay your premium monthly by direct debit or annually, in full, by debit or credit card only. We do not accept payment by cheque. If you have chosen to pay by direct debit, we will collect your premium on a monthly basis and it’s up to you to make sure your monthly payments are available for collection. The first payment in any policy year may be more or less than your monthly premium if your policy start date is different to your chosen direct debit collection date. This may also occur if you decide to change your direct debit collection date mid policy year. Where your premium is collected by your broker, your monthly direct debit will automatically roll over at your next renewal date. If you wish to change your bank details or change to an annual payment, please contact your broker directly. 5 General Terms and Conditions >Your policy is governed at all times by the laws of Ireland and the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland; >All policy documents and communications to members will be in English.

If your policy was arranged through a group scheme sponsor, your cover will continue as long as you fulfil the conditions for participation in the group scheme and the group scheme sponsor continues to pay your premium. 9 Premium Changes We may change the premium payable for our plans from time to time. These changes will not affect you until your next renewal date unless you change your plan during your policy year. Please note that we deduct your tax relief from your premium so you don’t have to claim it back from the Revenue Commissioners. The level of tax relief is set by the Government and may be changed at any time which is outside our control. We are legally obliged to apply tax changes immediately and this may result in a change to the amount that you are required to pay to us for the plans listed in your policy. 10 Your Contacts When contacting our numbers below, please quote your membership number which is detailed on your policy documentation or digital membership card.

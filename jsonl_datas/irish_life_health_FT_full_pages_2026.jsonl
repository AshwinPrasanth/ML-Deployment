However, the terms and conditions of this \ncontract will apply to all plans and all claims made under the \npolicy. Therefore, where we refer to ‘you’ and ‘your’ throughout \nthis Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder \nand the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to \nmembers of group schemes. If you  are a member of a group \nscheme where your employer has arranged your cover and is \npaying all or part of your premium, the Group Schemes section \nin this Membership Handbook will also apply to you.\nYou must ensure that the information that is provided to us when \nyou  are taking out a policy (whether in an application form or \notherwise) is accurate and complete (even where the information \nis being provided to us by someone on your behalf). Otherwise, \nit could mean we won’t pay a claim under the policy and some \nor all of the members’ plans under the policy may be cancelled. \nThis may also cause difficulty should you  wish to purchase \nhealth insurance elsewhere.\nUnderstanding your cover\nHealth insurance cover can be difficult to understand so to help \nyou  check your cover we  have set out a checklist below. We \nunderstand that it may be difficult for you to figure out whether \nyou are covered yourself so if you’re in any way unsure, please \ncall us on 01 562 5100 and we ’ll walk you through it. In fact, we \nwould always advise you  to check your cover with us before \nundergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted \nto a medical facility. When checking your cover with us, you  \nwill need to tell us where you  intend to have the procedure or \ntreatment performed, the name of your health care provider \nand the procedure/treatment code. You can get this information \nfrom your health care provider.\nThe checklists below explain what to look for to see if you  are \ncovered under your Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits or \nIn-patient Benefits. You will notice that some of your benefits will \nbe classed as Maternity Benefits or Other Benefits on your Table of \nCover.

For this reason, \nwe would advise you to contact us or your health care provider \nbefore undergoing your procedure or treatment to confirm \nwhether it will be covered by us. The Schedule of Benefits can be \naccessed on our website at Irishlifehealth.ie or a hard copy can \nbe requested from us.\nThe Lists\nThese Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and \nin some cases contain criteria which must be satisfied before \nthe benefit will apply.

Approval is only given where the \nprocedure or treatment meets specific clinical indicators or we  \ndetermine that it will result in a reasonably favourable medical \nprognosis. If your treatment or procedure needs to be pre-\nauthorised, this will be specified in the Schedule of Benefits. To \napply for pre-authorisation, your health care provider must \nsubmit a request in writing to Irish Life Health in order for your \nclaim to be considered. We will assess your request as soon as \npossible but in any case within 15 working days.\nThe treatment must begin, or surgical procedure must be \nperformed, before your pre-authorisation expires. Your pre-\nauthorisation will end either six months from when it is granted, \nor if you  change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you \ncease to be a member of Irish Life Health, whichever is sooner.\nYour health care provider\nIn most cases your treatment or procedure will be carried out by \nyour consultant but there are some treatments and procedures \nlisted in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by your \nGP , dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. The professional fees \nof health professionals can be covered as an In-patient Benefit, \nan Out-patient Benefit or a Day-to-day Benefit depending on type \nof care you  receive.\nGenerally when you  receive a procedure or treatment that is \nlisted in the Schedule of Benefits, your health care provider’s \nfees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits. We fully \ncover health care providers who are registered with us and \nhave agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their \nprofessional fees (i.e. a participating health care provider). You  \nwill have to pay most, or all, of your health care provider’s fees \nyourself if they are not registered with us or are not participating. \nPlease see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for a full \nexplanation about how your health care provider’s professional \nfees are covered under your In-patient Benefits.\nGenerally an out-patient consultation with a consultant or a visit \nto your GP or dentist will be covered as a Day-to-day Benefit or \nan Out-patient Benefit. In these circumstances it doesn’t matter \nif your consultant/GP/dentist is registered with Irish Life Health \nor is participating. Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits \nusually allow you  to claim a contribution from us towards a \ncertain number of visits to your consultant/GP/dentist in your \npolicy year. If these benefits are available under your plan, the \namount you  can claim back per visit and the number of visits for \nwhich you  can claim will be shown in your Table of Cover.\nWaiting periods\nYour medical expenses will not be covered until after your waiting \nperiods have expired. Waiting periods are explained in section 6 of \nthis Membership Handbook.\nExcess/Shortfall/Co-payment\nYou  will need to pay any excess, shortfall or co-payment that \napplies to a benefit or a group of benefits under your plan. \nYou  can’t claim these expenses back from us. You can see if an \nexcess, shortfall or co-payment applies by checking your Table \nof Cover. See sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Membership Handbook \nfor more information on excesses, shortfalls and co-payments.Understanding changes to your cover\n1. Changes to your plan on renewal \nFrom time to time we alter the benefits available under our \nplans. If we alter the plan that you  are on, the benefit changes \nwill not affect you  during your policy year but will apply if \nyou  purchase that plan at your next renewal.Therefore, it is \nimportant to remember that where you renew on the same plan \nthe benefits may not be the same as they were in your previous \npolicy year.\n2. Changes to your cover throughout your policy year\nIn some cases, the cover that is available under your plan may \nchange throughout your policy year for the following reasons:\nChanges to the Schedule of Benefits\nWe review and where necessary amend the Schedule of Benefits \nregularly to update the procedures and treatments that are \ncovered by us and the clinical indicators conditions of payment \nand/or payment indicators that apply to procedures and \ntreatments. These changes may become effective during your \npolicy year. You can find the most current versions of these on \nour website or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover.\nChanges to the List of Medical Facilities\nWe may add medical facilities to the List of Medical Facilities \nfrom time to time. We may also need to remove medical \nfacilities from the List of Medical Facilities if our arrangement \nwith those medical facilities ends. The medical facilities which \nwill be paid directly by us may also change from time to time. \nSee section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further details. \nYou can find the most current versions of these lists on our \nwebsite or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover.\nChanges to The Lists\nWe may need to make changes to the Lists from time to time \nto update the procedures, treatments and appliances that \nare covered under certain benefits and review the clinical \nindications, conditions of payment and/or payment indicators \nthat are applied to them. You can find the most current versions \nof these on our website or call us on 01 562 5100 to check cover.\nChanges to the status of health care provider\nYour health care provider’s status with us (i.e. whether they \nare registered and are a participating health care provider) may \nchange from time to time. This means that the amount of their \nprofessional fees that we will cover may change throughout \nyour policy year. You  can check whether your health care \nprovider is registered with Irish Life Health and whether they \nare a participating health care provider by contacting us on 01 \n562 5100. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook \nfor further information on how your health care provider’s \nstatus affects how their fees are covered.\nChanges to benefits provided by provider partners\nProvider partners benefits may change or cease during the \npolicy year and such changes are outside of our control.\nChanges required by law\nIn the event that we are legally required to make changes to any \nof our contracts, policies or plans, such changes shall effect \nyour plan immediately.\nThe changes described above are automatically applied to all \nour plans as soon as they occur.

You  will also be able to see on your Table of \nCover if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies.\nHow our benefits are categorised can change on different \nplans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear \nin different sections in this Membership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is \nnot explained in the corresponding table in this Membership \nHandbook, please check the tables in other sections of this \nMembership Handbook. The terms and conditions that apply \nto our benefits (as described in the tables below) will always \napply even if the benefit is positioned in a different section of \nyour Table of Cover.\nIf a day-to-day excess or an out-patient excess applies to \nyour plan, this will apply per policy year and will always \naffect all the benefits included in those sections of your \nTable of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one or more of your Day-\nto-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits appear in a different \nsection in this Membership Handbook.\nYou will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the \nMinimum Benefit Regulations for the medical services listed \nin those regulations (subject to any waiting periods). Please \nsee section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership \nHandbook for an explanation of the Minimum Benefit \nRegulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or \nother deductions required by law before paying your claim."}

There may be a limit to the number of \ntimes in your policy year that you  can claim a refund for a visit to \na particular medical practitioner or for a particular service. In some \ncases the benefit is only available for a specific provider partner. \nWhere this is the case, the provider partner will be named in the \ntables above. In addition, the number of refunds that you  can \nclaim for specified practitioners collectively may be limited (this \nis known as “combined visits”). Please note that there may be a \nlimit on the total amount that we  will pay for Day-to-day Benefits \nor Out-patient Benefits in a policy year. This limit will apply before \nthe deduction of any applicable policy excess.\nIn addition, an excess may apply to the total amount you claim \nunder your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in your \npolicy year. So for example, where an excess applies to the Out-\npatient Benefits under your plan, it applies to the total amount \nyou are claiming for all your Out-patient Benefits in your policy \nyear.

They include hospital accommodation costs, charges \nfor the use of the operating theatres, charges for radiology and \npathology, nursing charges, costs of prosthesis and charges for \ndrugs administered for consumption whilst you are admitted. \nYou can find the level of cover available for your hospital costs \nin a public hospital, private hospital and high-tech hospital in \nyour Table of Cover (see section entitled “Hospital Cover”). You  \ncan check whether your hospital is public, private or high-tech in \nthe tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership \nHandbook. Treatment centres are classed as private hospitals \nin terms of your level of cover. Any excess or co-payment \nspecified on your Table of Cover in respect of private hospital \ncover will not apply to treatment centres but any shortfalls \nspecified will.\nMedical facilities covered under your  plan\nThe medical facilities covered under your plan are shown in \nyour List of Medical Facilities. There are four of these lists but \nonly one will apply to your plan. You  can see which one applies \nto you  in your Table of Cover. The Lists of Medical Facilities are \ncontained in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this \nMembership Handbook.\nWhere you  are admitted to a medical facility covered under your \nplan, and where it is medically necessary, your hospital costs will \nbe fully covered subject to any limitations specified in your Table \nof Cover, such as excesses, (subject to exceptions as outlined \nunder In-patient or Day Case excess section below), shortfalls, \nco-payments, private rooms covered at semi-private rates, etc. \nWhere necessary, we have agreements with medical facilities \nto ensure that this is the case. However, medical facilities are \nfree to end their arrangement with us at any time so we  cannot \nguarantee that this will continue to be the case for all the medical \nfacilities covered under your plan throughout your policy year. \nWhere this arrangement between us and a medical facility ends, \nthe medical facility will no longer be covered by us and it will be \nremoved from all the Lists of Medical Facilities. Similarly, where \nwe enter into new arrangements with medical facilities, they will \nbe added to one or more of the Lists of Medical Facilities. Such \nchanges will affect your plan immediately. Up-to-date Lists of \nMedical Facilities are available on our website at Irishlifehealth.\nie. We recommend that you  always check whether your medical \nfacility is covered before being admitted by reviewing your List of \nMedical Facilities on our website or contacting our call centre on  \n01 562 5100.\nMedical facilities not covered on your plan\nWe will not cover your hospital costs in a medical facility which \nis not covered in your List of Medical Facilities.We have made every effort to ensure that all health services that \nare listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations (“Prescribed \nHealth Services”) are available through at least one of the \nmedical facilities covered in your List of Medical Facilities. In the \nunlikely event that a Prescribed Health Service is not available \nin one of those medical facilities, we will cover the Prescribed \nHealth Service in a medical facility that is not covered in your \nList of Medical Facilities as if it was covered under your plan (i.e. \nto the level of cover available under your In-patient Benefits). \nHowever, you must notify us in advance that you  wish to receive \nsuch medical services in a medical facility that is not covered \nunder your plan. Please note that we will not cover you if you  \nreceive health services (other than emergency care), which are \nnot listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, in a medical \nfacility which is not covered under your plan.\nWe will cover your stay in a public hospital that is not covered \nunder your List of Medical Facilities whilst you  are receiving \nemergency care, provided the public hospital is listed on one \nof the Lists of Medical Facilities covered by Irish Life Health. You  \nmust have been admitted through the accident and emergency \ndepartment. Any follow on care and/or elective treatments \nor procedures will only be covered in a medical facility which \nis covered under your plan. The only exception to this is if our \nmedical advisers agree that you are not medically fit to travel, in \nwhich case we  will cover your hospital costs in the same public \nhospital but this will need to be pre-authorised by us.\nHow long are your hospital costs covered for?\nYou  can claim hospital costs under your In-patient Benefits for \na total of 180 days in a calendar year (the “Maximum Period”). \nThis Maximum Period includes the number of days for which \nyou  can claim hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care \nprogrammes as a psychiatric patient. The number of days that \nyou  can claim as a psychiatric patient is shown in the psychiatric \ntreatment benefits in your Table of Cover.\nPlease note that the Maximum Period includes any days for which \nyou  have already claimed hospital costs (including hospital costs  \nor approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric \npatient) under another plan with us or with another health insurer \nin a calendar year.\nYour health care provider’s fees\nConsultants\nYour in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees covers the \nprofessional fees of consultants who are registered with Irish \nLife Health, where they provide you  with the treatments \nand procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits. Your \nconsultant’s fees will only be covered where your procedure \nor treatment is performed in a medical facility covered under \nyour plan. However, there is a small number of treatments and \nprocedures which will be covered when they are performed in \nyour consultant’s room. These are set out in the “non-hospital” \nsection of the Schedule of Benefits.\nConsultants registered with Irish Life Health\nWe will only cover consultants who are registered with Irish \nLife Health. Where your consultant  is registered with us, the \nextent to which their professional fees are covered will depend \non whether they have chosen to be a participating consultant or \nstandard rate consultant.\n• Participating consultants"}

This \nmeans that if your consultant is a participating consultant, \nyou will be fully covered for the procedures and treatments \nlisted in the Schedule of Benefits provided the consultant is \noperating within the rules imposed by the HSE relating to his \ncapacity to practice privately.\n•  Standard rate consultants\nStandard rate consultants (or part participating consultants) \nhave not agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement \nof their fees. Only a small portion of the fees of standard rate \nconsultants will be covered for performing the procedures \nand treatments in the Schedule of Benefits. Therefore, if your \nconsultant is a standard rate consultant you  will have to pay \na large portion of their fees yourself. You  will not be able to \nclaim this back from us.\nConsultants not registered with Irish Life Health\nWhere your consultant is not registered with Irish Life Health \nwe will not cover their professional fees. The only exception to \nthis is if your consultant’s fees for performing your treatment or \nprocedure are included in the Minimum Benefit Regulations. \nIf they are, you  can claim the amount set out in the Minimum \nBenefit Regulations back from us at the end of your policy \nyear. It’s important you  know your consultant’s fees are likely to \nbe a lot more than the amount shown in the Minimum Benefit \nRegulations. If this happens, you ’ll have to pay the difference.\nDentists/Oral surgeons/Periodontists\nYour in-patient benefit for consultant’s fees also covers a \nlimited number of dental/oral surgical procedures where they \nare performed by a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. (This \nexcludes dentist visits and emergency dental care which are \ncovered under our Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits).\nThe dental/oral surgical procedures that are covered under our \nIn-patient Benefits are listed in the “Periodontal/Oral/Dental \nSurgery Ground Rules” section of the Schedule of Benefits. These \nprocedures will only be covered where they are performed by \nthe specified type of dental practitioner (i.e. a dentist, oral \nsurgeon or periodontist). Please note many dental/oral surgical \nprocedures require pre-authorisation. Your dentist/oral \nsurgeon/periodontist’s fees will only be covered where your \noral/dental surgery is performed in a medical facility covered \nunder your plan or in your dentist/oral surgeon/periodontist’s \nroom.\nAs with your consultant, your dentist, oral surgeon or \nperiodontist must be registered with Irish Life Health. If they \nare not registered with us, you  will not be covered (subject to \ncover prescribed under the Minimum Benefit Regulations, \nif applicable). The extent to which your oral surgeon/\nperiodontist’s professional fees are covered will also depend on \nwhether they have chosen to be a participating or a standard rate \noral surgeon/periodontist. See the consultant section above \nfor a full explanation on how your oral health care provider’s \nstatus as participating or standard rate affects your cover. Please \nnote that all dentists are classed as standard rate so we  will only \ncover a limited portion of your dentist’s fees for performing oral/\ndental surgery.\nGPs\nWe will cover your GP’s fees for performing a limited number of treatments and procedures in their surgery. Such procedures \nand treatments are covered under your in-patient benefit for \nconsultant’s fees. Your GP’s fees for a routine visit will be covered \nunder our Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits. The \ntreatments and procedures that will be covered under your In-\npatient Benefits are set out in the GP section. If your treatment \nor procedure is not listed in the GP section, your GP’s fees will \nnot be covered. As with consultants and dental professionals, \nyour GP must be registered with Irish Life Health before they \nwill be covered and the extent to which their fees are covered \nwill depend on whether they are a participating GP or a standard \nrate GP. Please see previous sections for a full explanation on \nthe effect of your health care provider not being registered with \nIrish Life Health and not participating with Irish Life Health.\nChanges to the status of your health care provider\nHealth care providers are free to alter their arrangement with \nIrish Life Health at any time. Therefore, by way of example, \na participating health care provider may choose to become \nstandard rate or to unregister with us at any time. Any changes to \ntheir status with us will affect how they are covered immediately. \nTherefore, the level to which their fees are covered may change \nthroughout your policy year. We recommend that you  always \ncheck whether your health care provider is registered with \nIrish Life Health and whether they are participating or standard \nrate before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being \nadmitted to a medical facility. You  can do this by visiting our \nwebsite or contacting our call centre on 01 562 5100.\nMaternity treatment\nIn-patient Benefits do not apply where you  are admitted to \na medical facility for the delivery of your baby (except for \ncaesarean section deliveries). Whilst you are admitted for the \ndelivery of your baby, you  are a maternity patient and your \nMaternity Benefits apply. The level of cover available to you  \nfor your maternity care is set out in your Maternity Benefits on \nyour Table of Cover. Where your maternity care ends, but you  \nremain admitted for any medically necessary reason, your In-\npatient Benefits will apply and you will receive the level of cover \navailable under the In-patient Benefits on your Table of Cover.\nPsychiatric treatment\nWhere you  are admitted to a psychiatric medical facility or a \npsychiatric unit in a medical facility, your hospital costs and \nconsultant’s fees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits \nat the level shown in the Hospital Cover section of your Table of \nCover. Your plan will also include psychiatric treatment benefits. \nThese benefits specify the maximum number of days for which \nyou  can claim your In-patient Benefits whilst you  are a psychiatric \npatient for medically necessary treatment. If you  are admitted \nto an approved psychiatric home care programme provided \nby a private psychiatric medical facility, the number of days \nclaimed will be deducted from the maximum covered under your  \npsychiatric treatment benefits.\nHow In-patient Benefits are claimed\nIn most cases, we’ll pay the amount for which you  are covered \nunder your In-patient Benefits directly to your medical facility \nand health care providers.

The consultant’s booking fee is not \ncovered under this benefit but you  may be able to claim back some of that fee under our “Out-patient maternity \nconsultant fees” benefit or our pre/post-natal maternity costs benefit if these are available on your plan); or\nb)   pay the contribution specified in your Table of Cover towards your in-patient hospital costs. \nThe type of cover available to you  will depend on your plan and is set out in your Table of Cover. This benefit is only \navailable where you  have been admitted to a public hospital covered on your plan to give birth. This benefit is only \navailable for the first three nights of your hospital stay. Where it is medically necessary for you  to remain in hospital \nfor more than 3 nights, your fourth and subsequent night’s stay will be covered under your In-patient Benefits so the \nlevel of cover available for a public hospital stay under your in-patient benefits will apply.\nIt is important to note that the level of in-patient cover under your in-patient benefits and your maternity benefits \nmay be different. For example, if you have cover for a private room under your maternity benefits but a semi-\nprivate room under your in-patient benefits, you will only be covered for a semi–private room for your fourth and \nsubsequent night’s stay. In this case you  should ask to be moved to a semi-private room after your third night or you  \nwill have to pay the balance. Please note that caesarean section deliveries are covered under your In-patient Benefits \nand not under this benefit. \nIn-patient maternity \nconsultant feesUnder this benefit we  will either:\n >Cover the professional fees of your baby’s paediatrician;\n >Cover your anaesthetist’s and pathologist’s professional fees; and\n >Cover your consultant’s professional fees.\nOr:\n >Pay the contribution specified in the Table of Cover towards your consultants’ professional fees.\nThe type of cover available under your plan is set out in your Table of Cover.

If your medical expenses exceed this amount, we will pay the maximum contribution to your medical facility or health \ncare provider and you  will need to pay them the balance. If your care is provided by an approved medical facility based in Northern Ireland, all \nclaims will be assessed and settled in euro. Irish Life Health will use the foreign exchange rate which applies at the date of the invoice received \nfrom the medical facility or at the time of purchase, as appropriate.

This is because the excesses that \napply to these benefits are generally lower than those that apply \nto your general hospital costs in a high-tech hospital.

We provide two \nbenefits under our Elective Overseas Referral benefits; \n(A) ‘Elective Procedure Abroad - for procedures that are available in Ireland’ and \n(B) ‘Elective Procedure Abroad - for procedures that are not available in Ireland’ \nThe table below explains both our ‘Elective Overseas Referral’ benefits but you  should check your Table of Cover to see if these \nbenefits are covered under your plan. All elective medical care received abroad must be pre-authorised by Irish Life Health. See the \n“How to Claim” section of the table below for details of how to have your elective overseas medical care pre-authorised by us . Please \nnote  you  will only be covered up to the amount pre-authorised by us . Your overseas medical facility and health care providers may \ncharge more than this amount. If they do, you  will be responsible for paying the balance. In addition we do not pay overseas medical \nfacilities and health care providers directly. you  will need to pay your entire bill to the medical facility and/ or health care providers \nyourself. you  can then claim the pre-authorised amount from us by submitting your receipts. When you  submit an Irish Life Health \nOverseas Pre-Approval Form to us , our medical advisers will decide whether the surgical procedure you require abroad is available \nin Ireland. This can require a complex medical assessment of the treatments and procedures you wish to receive abroad and the \ntreatments and procedures available in Ireland to treat your condition. The decision of our medical advisers is final. In addition, \ntheir assessment is based entirely on the information you  provide in advance of your undergoing your procedure (in your Irish Life \nHealth Overseas Pre-Approval Form). The amount pre-authorised by us cannot be reassessed following your treatment regardless of \nwhether the treatment you receive differs from that anticipated in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form or otherwise. \nIf there are any unforeseen medical costs arising in relation to additional medically necessary treatment from the same episode of \ncare, we will cover you  for an amount up to the same amount of the costs that would have arisen and for which you  would be covered \nfor in Ireland. \nPlease note that the following conditions apply to Elective Overseas Referrals: \n >The surgical procedure must be performed or treatment must commence within 31 days from when you  leave Ireland; \n >you must have been referred for the surgical procedure abroad by a participating consultant in Ireland or through the International \nSecond Opinion Service benefit, if applicable; \n >The surgical procedure must be performed before your pre-authorisation expires. Your pre-authorisation will end either six \nmonths from when it is granted, or if you  change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you  cease to be a member of Irish \nLife Health, whichever is sooner;"}

Irish Life Health will not contribute to the cost of getting a written medical opinion from your GP or Consultant. We will \nassess your pre-authorisation request within 15 working days and confirm the amount for which you are covered. You  will need to pay your \noverseas medical facility and health care providers directly for your medical care. You  can then claim the amount we  have pre-authorised \nback from us by submitting your original receipts to us in an envelope with your name, address and membership number (see section 10 for \ndetails of where to send your receipts). Unfortunately, we are unable to return your original receipts to you , so we suggest that you  keep a \ncopy of your receipts for your records.

We will not return the amount of \npremium for any cover received before the date of cancellation.

The government levy is a stamp duty which is \npayable on health insurance plans. A full explanation of the \ngovernment levy is contained in the Definitions section of \nthis Membership Handbook.\nWe reserve the right to deduct the amount for the mid-term \ncancellation charge against any amount due to be refunded. In \nall other cases we  will send you  an invoice in respect of the mid-\nterm cancellation charge. A mid-term cancellation charge also \napplies to policies paid by direct debit.\nCooling Off\nYou  can cancel your policy free of charge within 14 working days \nfrom the date the policy was entered into or from the date you  \nare given the policy documentation, whichever is the later. This \nis known as the cooling off period. We’ll give you  a full refund of \npremium unless you  or any member has made a claim during \nthis period. If a claim has been made and you  wish to cancel \nyour policy from the start date, the cost of any out-patient claim \nwill be deducted from the refund due and you will be liable for \nany charge relating to in-patient care. Should you  wish to cancel \nyour policy with effect from a date later than the start date, we \nwill charge you  for providing health insurance cover up to the \ndate of cancellation and we will apply a mid-term cancellation \ncharge in this case.Paying your premiums\nAll premiums must be paid in euro. We have a number of \npayment options which are outlined below.\nYou  can pay your premium monthly by direct debit or annually, \nin full, by debit or credit card only. We do not accept payment \nby cheque. \nIf you have chosen to pay by direct debit, we will collect your  \npremium on a monthly basis and it’s up to you  to make sure your  \nmonthly payments are available for collection. The first payment \nin any policy year may be more or less than your monthly \npremium if your policy start date is different to your chosen direct \ndebit collection date. This may also occur if you  decide to change \nyour direct debit collection date mid policy year.\nWhere your premium is collected by your broker, your monthly \ndirect debit will automatically roll over at your next renewal \ndate.

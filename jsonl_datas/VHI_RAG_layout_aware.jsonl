The premium must be paid when it becomes due for the duration of Your Policy. The Policyholder is responsible for ensuring payments are made. 2. If You pay by salary deduction, the division of the annual premium into monthly or weekly payments may result in the collection of marginally more or less than the annual premium. This happens because payments are rounded to the nearest cent. 3. If You have more than one product and You do not pay the full amount, We will allocate the amount paid proportionately to each product based on the overall premium due. i For example, if You have 2 products with Us with premiums of €100 and €50 respectively, the total premium will be €150. If You only make a payment of €100 (i.e. two-thirds of the amount owed) We will treat that payment as if You have paid two-thirds of the premium for each product. 4. We will lodge all payments received in Our bank account. We will send a receipt for all payments. However, this does not mean the payment has been accepted as fulfilment of Your contract if the amount received does not match the amount requested or the agreed portion of same.

Direct pay – This is where We pay the treatment provider directly; or 2. Pay and claim back – This is where You have to pay for the treatment and then claim the amount of any covered Benefit from Us. i Whether or not a particular treatment is covered by a direct pay arrangement will depend on the type of treatment, the level of Your Policy and the facility providing the treatment. In most cases the treatment provider will be able to confirm whether a treatment is covered by a direct pay arrangement. If You are not sure, You can check via MyVhi, the ‘Check your Health Cover’ feature in the Vhi app or by calling Us. Other Insurance Cover If You, or anyone else covered by Your Policy, are entitled to claim under any other insurance policy for any of the costs, charges or fees, We will only pay the amount in Excess of the other insurance. You must tell Us if You have other insurance when making a claim. We do not allow dual insurance. This means that You cannot hold two policies that cover the same expenses with Us. Excess We will not make any payment unless the Excess is exceeded. Hospital excesses are paid by You directly to the hospital. The hospital will then send the remaining bill directly to Vhi. Everyday Medical Expenses Excess is deducted from the eligible amount You claim back from Us. We will not refund the In-Patient Treatment Excess amount. You can find more information on excesses at vhi.ie. Shortfall in Benefits A shortfall is the amount of Your treatment that is not covered by Your Policy. You must pay this amount yourself.

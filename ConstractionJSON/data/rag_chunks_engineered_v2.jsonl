Where these terms appear in the text, it is important that you understand the meaning and read these in conjunction with the rest of terms and conditions throughout this document. 1 1 Your Contract Everything you need to know about your policy Your contract with us is made up of the following: > Your Membership Handbook > Your completed Application Form, whether completed by you or on your behalf (if applicable) > Your policy documentation, which sets out your plan, your membership number, your commencement date and your next renewal date > Your Table of Cover, which outlines the benefits in your plan and which List of Medical Facilities applies to your plan > The Schedule of Benefits, which sets out the treatments and procedures we cover > The Lists (explained below) > Terms of Business > Data Privacy Notice Health insurance policies are contracts between the insurer and the policyholder, because the policyholder (or in some cases their employer) is the person who has arranged and paid for the policy. However, the terms and conditions of this contract will apply to all plans and all claims made under the policy. Therefore where we refer to \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 throughout this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to members of group schemes. If you are a member of a group scheme where your employer has arranged your cover and is paying all or part of your premium, the Group Schemes section in this Membership Handbook will also apply to you. You must ensure that the information that is provided to us when you are taking out a policy (whether in an application form or otherwise) is accurate and complete (even where the information is being provided to us by someone on your behalf). Otherwise it could mean we won\u2019t pay a claim under the policy and some or all of the members\u2019 plans under the policy may be cancelled. This may also cause difficulty should you wish to purchase health insurance elsewhere. Understanding your cover Health insurance cover can be difficult to understand so to help you check your cover we have set out a checklist below. We understand that it may be difficult for you to figure out whether you are covered yourself so if you\u2019re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we \u2019ll walk you through it. In fact we you are covered yourself so if you\u2019re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we \u2019ll walk you through it. In fact we would always advise you to check your cover with us before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility. When checking your cover with us you will need to tell us where you intend to have the procedure or treatment performed; the name of your health care provider and the procedure/treatment code. You can get this information from your health care provider. The checklists below explain what to look for to see if you are covered under your Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits. You will notice that some of your benefits will be classed as Maternity Benefits or Other Benefits on your Table of Cover. Some of these benefits are claimed as Outpatient Benefits or In-patient Benefits and the checklists below will apply to these.

Your Membership Handbook As you can see, you will need to take many factors into account to see whether your health expenses are covered. Below is a short explanation of the contractual documents and other factors that you need to take into account to see if you are covered. 2 Membership Handbook This document: > will help guide you through your health insurance cover > explains the general terms and conditions of your contract with us > explains all our benefits including the terms and conditions which apply to each (but please note that all these benefits may not be available on your plan) > sets out the things that are not covered under your plan > explains how to make a claim Section 12 of this Membership Handbook contains tables which show the medical facilities that are covered under our plans. They also show if we pay them directly (known as direct settlement) or if you need to pay them yourself and claim this back from us. You will be covered for the medical facilities specified in one of four lists shown in the tables (your \u201cList of Medical Facilities\u201d). Your Table of Cover shows which List of Medical Facilities applies to you. Table of Cover Your Table of Cover sets out the benefits that are available under your plan. The Schedule of Benefits The Schedule of Benefits is sectioned by specialty and sets out the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these need to be pre-authorised. It shows the clinical indicators that the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these need to be pre-authorised. It shows the clinical indicators that must be present in order for a procedure or treatment to be covered. It also specifies that certain treatments and procedures will only be covered if they are performed by a certain type of health care provider or if they are performed in a certain place (i.e. in a hospital). The GP section sets out the procedures and treatments that we will cover when they are carried out by your GP in their surgery. It also shows which of these procedures and treatments require pre-authorisation and sets out any clinical indicators that apply. These documents contain medical language which is really designed to be read by doctors and consultants. For this reason, we would advise you to contact us or your health care provider before undergoing your procedure or treatment to confirm whether it will be covered by us. The Schedule of Benefits can be accessed on our website at www.irishlifehealth.ie/privacy-and-legal/schedule-ofbenefits or a hard copy can be requested from us. The Lists These Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and The Lists These Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and in some cases contain criteria which must be satisfied before the benefit will apply. We will let you know throughout this Membership Handbook or in your Table of Cover when it is necessary to refer to a List in connection with a benefit.

Ground rules We will only cover the costs of medical care which our medical advisers believe is an established treatment which is medically necessary. In addition we only cover reasonable and customary costs. Clinical indicators In some cases medical criteria known as clinical indicators need to be satisfied before our medical advisers will consider the treatment or procedure to be medically necessary. If clinical indicators apply, they will be set out alongside the procedure or treatment in the Schedule of Benefits or in the List of Clinical Indicators for Cardiac MRI and Cardiac CT Scans. 3 Pre-authorisation Certain procedures and treatments are not covered unless they are approved in advance by us. Approval is only given where the procedure or treatment meets specific clinical indicators or we determine that it will result in a reasonably favourable medical prognosis. If your treatment or procedure needs to be preauthorised, this will be specified in the Schedule of Benefits. To apply for pre-authorisation, your health care provider must submit a request in writing to Irish Life Health in order for your claim to be considered. We will assess your request as soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days. The treatment must begin, or surgical procedure must be performed, before your pre-authorisation expires. Your preauthorisation will end either six months from when it is granted, or if you change your plan and reduce your level of cover, or if you cease to be a member of Irish Life Health, whichever is sooner. Your health care provider In most cases your treatment or procedure will be carried out by your consultant but there are some treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by your your consultant but there are some treatments and procedures listed in the Schedule of Benefits which can be performed by your GP , dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. The professional fees of health professionals can be covered as an In-patient Benefit, an Out-patient Benefit or a Day-to-day Benefit depending on type of care you receive. Generally when you receive a procedure or treatment that is listed in the Schedule of Benefits, your health care provider\u2019s fees will be covered under your In-patient Benefits. We fully cover health care providers who are registered with us and have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their professional fees (i.e. a participating health care provider). You will have to pay most, or all, of your health care provider\u2019s fees yourself if they are not registered with us or are not participating. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for a full explanation about how your health care provider\u2019s professional fees are covered under your In-patient Benefits. Generally an out-patient consultation with a consultant or a visit to your GP or dentist will be covered as a Day-to-day Benefit or Generally an out-patient consultation with a consultant or a visit to your GP or dentist will be covered as a Day-to-day Benefit or an Out-patient Benefit. In these circumstances it doesn\u2019t matter if your consultant/GP/dentist is registered with Irish Life Health or is participating. Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits usually allow you to claim a contribution from us towards a certain number of visits to your consultant/GP/dentist in your policy year. If these benefits are available under your plan, the amount you can claim back per visit and the number of visits for which you can claim will be shown in your Table of Cover. Waiting periods Your medical expenses will not be covered until after your waiting periods have expired. Waiting periods are explained in section 6 of this Membership Handbook. Excess/Shortfall/Co-payment You will need to pay any excess, shortfall or co-payment that applies to a benefit or a group of benefits under your plan. You can\u2019t claim these expenses back from us. You can see if an excess, shortfall or co-payment applies by checking your Table of Cover. See sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Membership Handbook excess, shortfall or co-payment applies by checking your Table of Cover. See sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for more information on excesses, shortfalls and co-payments. Understanding changes to your cover 1. Changes to your plan on renewal From time to time we alter the benefits available under our plans. If we alter the plan that you are on, the benefit changes will not affect you during your policy year but will apply if you purchase that plan at your next renewal. Therefore, it is important to remember that where you renew on the same plan the benefits may not be the same as they were in your previous policy year. 2. Changes to your cover throughout your policy year In some cases the cover that is available under your plan may change throughout your policy year for the following reasons: Changes to the Schedule of Benefits We review and where necessary amend the Schedule of Benefits regularly to update the procedures and treatments that are covered by us and the clinical indicators, conditions of payment and/or payment indicators that apply to procedures and treatments.

We may also need to remove medical facilities from the Lists of Medical Facilities if our arrangement with those medical facilities ends.

Changes to the status of health care provider Your health care provider\u2019s status with us (i.e. whether they are registered and are a participating health care provider) may change from time to time. This means that the amount of their professional fees that we will cover may change throughout your policy year. You can check whether your health care provider is registered with Irish Life Health and whether they are a participating health care provider by contacting us on 01 562 5100. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for further information on how your health care provider\u2019s status affects how their fees are covered. Changes to benefits provided by provider partners Provider partner benefits may change or cease during the policy year and such changes are outside of our control.

The changes described above are automatically applied to all of our contracts, policies or plans, such changes shall effect your plan immediately. The changes described above are automatically applied to all our plans as soon as they occur. You and the members named on your policy should always check the most recent Schedule 4 of Benefits, The List of Medical Facilities and Lists, and check whether your health care provider is registered with us and whether they are participating before undergoing any procedure or treatment, or being admitted to a medical facility. You can do this yourself by checking the most up to date information on our website or you can call us and we will check this for you.

In particular, you are confirming that you understand the contractual documents that make up your contract with us and that your cover may change throughout your policy year. 2 Your Cover & How to Claim The benefits available under your plan are shown in your Table of Cover. They are divided into different sections mainly due to how they are claimed or the type of expenses covered.

Hospital costs The fees charged by your hospital or treatment centre for your medical care whilst you are admitted are known as hospital costs. They include hospital accommodation costs, charges for the use of the operating theatres, charges for radiology and pathology, nursing charges, costs of prosthesis and charges for drugs administered for consumption whilst you are admitted. You can find the level of cover available for your hospital costs in a public hospital, private hospital and high-tech hospital in your Table of Cover (see section entitled \u201cHospital Cover\u201d). You can check whether your hospital is public, private or high-tech in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Please note that some hospitals may be classed as a high-tech hospital for selected Level 1 plans and a private hospital for all other plans. Treatment centres are classed as a high-tech hospital for selected Level 1 plans and a private hospital for all other plans. Treatment centres are classed as private hospitals in terms of your level of cover. Any excess or copayment specified on your Table of Cover in respect of private hospital cover will not apply to treatment centres but any shortfalls specified will. Medical facilities covered under your plan The medical facilities covered under your plan are shown in your List of Medical Facilities. There are four of these lists but only one will apply to your plan. You can see which one applies to you in your Table of Cover. All the Lists of Medical Facilities are contained in the tables of medical facilities in section 12 of this Membership Handbook. Where you are admitted to a medical facility covered under your plan and where it is medically necessary, your hospital costs will be fully covered subject to any limitations specified in your Table of Cover, such as excesses (subject to exceptions as outlined under In-patient or Day Case excess section below), shortfalls, co-payments, private rooms covered at semi-private rates etc. under In-patient or Day Case excess section below), shortfalls, co-payments, private rooms covered at semi-private rates etc. Where necessary, we have agreements with medical facilities to ensure that this is the case. However, medical facilities are free to end their arrangement with us at any time so we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case for all the medical facilities covered under your plan throughout your policy year. Where this arrangement between us and a medical facility ends, the medical facility will no longer be covered by us and it will be removed from * We will only cover the costs of visits to practitioners who have appropriate qualifications and registrations. Please see our Directory of Allied Health Professionals, Alternative (Complementary) and Other Practitioners in section 11.1 of this Membership Handbook for details of the qualifications and registrations which each practitioner must hold. ** The provider partners named under these benefits may change from time to time. Access to these benefits is subject to availability and the ** The provider partners named under these benefits may change from time to time. Access to these benefits is subject to availability and the provider partners\u2019 terms and conditions of use. Our provider partners operate independently from Irish Life Health and we accept no liability for the provision of their services and are not liable for any point of sale or other discounts which may be offered by a provider partner. Provider partner benefits may change or cease during the policy year and such changes are outside of our control. While we aim for nationwide coverage with our benefits, a service may not be available in your locality. Please also note that we are not responsible for the content of the websites of these provider partners. How to calculate your cover under your day-to-day benefits and out-patient benefits The amount that can be claimed under these benefits may be a set amount per visit or it may be a percentage of the cost of the visit up to a maximum amount per visit or per policy year. There may be a limit to the number of times in your policy year that you can up to a maximum amount per visit or per policy year. There may be a limit to the number of times in your policy year that you can claim a refund for a visit to a particular medical practitioner or for a particular service. In addition the number of refunds that you can claim for specified practitioners collectively may be limited (this is known as \u201ccombined visits\u201d). Please note that there may be a limit on the total amount that we will pay for Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in a policy year. This limit will apply before the deduction of any applicable policy excess. In addition an excess may apply to the total amount you claim under your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in your policy year. So for example, where an excess applies to the Out-patient Benefits under your plan, it applies to the total amount you are claiming for all your Out-patient Benefits in your policy year. When you submit your receipts to us we will calculate the total amount due to be refunded to you under all your Out-patient Benefits, subtract the excess and refund you the balance. For example: Example 1 Example 2 refunded to you under all your Out-patient Benefits, subtract the excess and refund you the balance. For example: Example 1 Example 2 Cover shown on Table of Cover \u20ac60 x 2 consultant visits 75% x 5 consultant visits Number of times you visited your consultant in your policy year and how much you paid per visit 2 x \u20ac100 5 x \u20ac100 Total amount that you can claim (the number of times you visited a consultant multiplied by the maximum amount that can be claimed per visit) 2 x \u20ac60 = \u20ac120 5 x \u20ac75 = \u20ac375 Less out-patient excess \u20ac150 \u20ac200 Money we pay you back \u20ac0 \u20ac175 16 17 all the Lists of Medical Facilities. Similarly where we enter into new arrangements with medical facilities, they will be added to one or more of the Lists of Medical Facilities. Such changes will affect your plan immediately. Up to date Lists of Medical Facilities are available on our website at www.irishlifehealth.ie. We recommend that you always check whether your medical facility is covered before being admitted by reviewing your List of Medical Facilities on our website or contacting our call centre on 01 562 5100. Medical facilities not covered on your plan We will not cover your hospital costs in a medical facility which is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities. We have made every effort to ensure that all health services that are listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations (\u201cPrescribed Health Services\u201d) are available through at least one of the medical facilities covered in your List of Medical Facilities. In the unlikely event that a Prescribed Health Service is not available in one of those medical facilities, we will cover the Prescribed Health Service in a medical facility that is not covered in your in one of those medical facilities, we will cover the Prescribed Health Service in a medical facility that is not covered in your List of Medical Facilities as if it was covered under your plan (i.e. to the level of cover available under your In-patient Benefits). However, you must notify us in advance that you wish to receive such medical services in a medical facility that is not covered under your plan. Please note that we will not cover you if you receive health services (other than emergency care), which are not listed in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, in a medical facility which is not covered under your plan. We will cover your stay in a public hospital that is not covered under your List of Medical Facilities whilst you are receiving emergency care, provided the public hospital is listed on one of the Lists of Medical Facilities covered by Irish Life Health. You must have been admitted through the accident and emergency department. Any follow on care and/or elective treatments or procedures will only be covered in a medical facility which is covered under your plan. The only exception to this is if our or procedures will only be covered in a medical facility which is covered under your plan.

How long are your hospital costs covered for? You can claim hospital costs under your In-patient Benefits for a total of 180 days in a calendar year (the \u201cMaximum Period\u201d). This Maximum Period includes the number of days for which you can claim hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient. The number of days that you can claim as a psychiatric patient is shown in the psychiatric treatment benefits in your Table of Cover. Please note that the Maximum Period includes any days for which you have already claimed hospital costs (including hospital costs or approved psychiatric home care programmes as a psychiatric patient) under another plan with us or with another health insurer in a calendar year.

Your consultant\u2019s fees will only be covered where your procedure or treatment is performed in a medical facility covered under your plan. However, there is a small number of treatments and procedures which will be covered when they are performed in your consultant\u2019s room. These are set out in the \u201cnon-hospital\u201d section of the Schedule of Benefits. Consultants registered with Irish Life Health We will only cover consultants who are registered with Irish Life Health. Where your consultant is registered with us, the extent to which their professional fees are covered will depend on whether they have chosen to be a participating consultant or standard rate consultant. \u2022 Participating consultants Participating consultants have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees for performing the \u2022 Participating consultants Participating consultants have agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees for performing the procedures and treatments in the Schedule of Benefits. This means that if your consultant is a participating consultant, you will be fully covered for the procedures and treatments listed in the Schedule of Benefits provided the consultant is operating within the rules imposed by the HSE relating to his capacity to practice privately. \u2022 Standard rate consultants Standard rate consultants (or part participating consultants) have not agreed to accept payment from us in full settlement of their fees. Only a small portion of the fees of standard rate consultants will be covered for performing the procedures and treatments in the Schedule of Benefits. Therefore, if your consultant is a standard rate consultant you will have to pay a large portion of their fees yourself. You will not be able to claim this back from us. Consultants not registered with Irish Life Health Where your consultant is not registered with Irish Life Health we will not cover their professional fees. The only exception to Where your consultant is not registered with Irish Life Health we will not cover their professional fees.

If they are, you can claim the amount set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations back from us at the end of your policy year. It\u2019s important you know your consultant\u2019s fees are likely to be a lot more than the amount shown in the Minimum Benefit Regulations. If this happens, you\u2019ll have to pay the difference. Dentists/Oral surgeons/Periodontists Your in-patient benefit for consultant\u2019s fees also covers a limited number of dental/oral surgical procedures where they are performed by a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist. (This excludes dental visits and emergency dental care which are covered under our Day-to-day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits).

These procedures will only be covered where they are performed by the Surgery Ground Rules\u201d section of the Schedule of Benefits. These procedures will only be covered where they are performed by the specified type of dental practitioner (i.e. a dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist). Please note many dental/oral surgical procedures require pre-authorisation. Your dentist/oral surgeon/ periodontist\u2019s fees will only be covered where your oral/dental surgery is performed in a medical facility covered under your plan or in your dentist/oral surgeon/periodontist\u2019s room. 18 As with your consultant, your dentist, oral surgeon or periodontist must be registered with Irish Life Health. If they are not registered with us, you will not be covered (subject to cover prescribed under the Minimum Benefit Regulations if applicable). The extent to which your oral surgeon/periodontist\u2019s professional fees are covered will also depend on whether they have chosen to be a participating or a standard rate oral surgeon/periodontist. See the consultant section above for a full explanation on how your oral health care provider\u2019s status as participating or standard rate affects your cover. Please note that all dentists are classed as standard rate so we will only cover a limited portion of your dentist\u2019s fees for performing oral/dental surgery. GPs We will cover your GPs fees for performing a limited number of treatments and procedures in their surgery. Such procedures and treatments are covered under your in-patient benefit for consultant\u2019s fees.

Changes to the status of your health care provider Health care providers are free to alter their arrangement with Irish Life Health at any time.

These benefits specify the maximum number of days for which you can claim your In-patient Benefits whilst you are a psychiatric patient for medically necessary treatment.

How In-patient Benefits are claimed In most cases, we\u2019ll pay the amount for which you are covered under your In-patient Benefits directly to your medical facility and health care providers.

However, the terms and conditions of this contract will apply to all plans and all claims made under the policy. Therefore, where we refer to \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 throughout this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to this Membership Handbook, we refer to both the policyholder and the member(s) listed on the policy. This also applies to members of group schemes. If you are a member of a group scheme where your employer has arranged your cover and is paying all or part of your premium, the Group Schemes section in this Membership Handbook will also apply to you. You must ensure that the information that is provided to us when you are taking out a policy (whether in an application form or otherwise) is accurate and complete (even where the information is being provided to us by someone on your behalf). Otherwise, it could mean we won\u2019t pay a claim under the policy and some or all of the members\u2019 plans under the policy may be cancelled. This may also cause difficulty should you wish to purchase health insurance elsewhere. Understanding your cover Health insurance cover can be difficult to understand so to help you check your cover we have set out a checklist below. We understand that it may be difficult for you to figure out whether you are covered yourself so if you\u2019re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we \u2019ll walk you through it. In fact, we you are covered yourself so if you\u2019re in any way unsure, please call us on 01 562 5100 and we \u2019ll walk you through it. In fact, we would always advise you to check your cover with us before undergoing any procedure or treatment or being admitted to a medical facility. When checking your cover with us, you will need to tell us where you intend to have the procedure or treatment performed, the name of your health care provider and the procedure/treatment code. You can get this information from your health care provider. The checklists below explain what to look for to see if you are covered under your Day-to-day Benefits, Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits. You will notice that some of your benefits will be classed as Maternity Benefits or Other Benefits on your Table of Cover. Some of these benefits are claimed as Out-patient Benefits or In-patient Benefits and the checklists below will apply to these.

Your Membership Handbook As you can see, you will need to take many factors into account to see whether your health expenses are covered. Below is a short explanation of the contractual documents and other factors that you need to take into account to see if you are covered. 3 Membership Handbook This document: > will help guide you through your health insurance cover > explains the general terms and conditions of your contract with us > explains all our benefits including the terms and conditions which apply to each (but please note that all these benefits may not be available on your plan) > sets out the things that are not covered under your plan > explains how to make a claim Section 12 of this Membership Handbook contains tables which show the medical facilities that are covered under our plans. They also show if we pay them directly (known as direct settlement) or if you need to pay them yourself and claim this back from us. You will be covered for the medical facilities specified in one of four lists shown in the tables (your \u201cList of Medical Facilities\u201d). Your Table of Cover shows which List of Medical Facilities applies to you. Table of Cover Your Table of Cover sets out the benefits that are available under your plan. The Schedule of Benefits The Schedule of Benefits is sectioned by specialty and sets out the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these The Schedule of Benefits The Schedule of Benefits is sectioned by specialty and sets out the treatments and procedures we cover and which of these need to be pre-authorised. It shows the clinical indicators that must be present in order for a procedure or treatment to be covered. It also specifies that certain treatments and procedures will only be covered if they are performed by a certain type of health care provider or if they are performed in a certain place (i.e. in a hospital). The GP section sets out the procedures and treatments that we will cover when they are carried out by your GP in their surgery. It also shows which of these procedures and treatments require pre-authorisation and sets out any clinical indicators that apply. These documents contain medical language which is really designed to be read by doctors and consultants. For this reason, we would advise you to contact us or your health care provider before undergoing your procedure or treatment to confirm whether it will be covered by us. The Schedule of Benefits can be accessed on our website at Irishlifehealth.ie or a hard copy can be requested from us. The Lists accessed on our website at Irishlifehealth.ie or a hard copy can be requested from us. The Lists These Lists show what is covered under certain benefits and in some cases contain criteria which must be satisfied before the benefit will apply. We will let you know throughout this Membership Handbook or in your Table of Cover when it is necessary to refer to a List in connection with a benefit. The Lists are available on our website www.irishlifehealth.ie/privacy-andlegal/schedule-of-benefits. The following is a brief explanation of each of the Lists: 1.

This is known as the cooling off period. We\u2019ll give you a full refund of premium unless you or any member has made a claim during this period. If a claim has been made and you wish to cancel your policy from the start date, the cost of any out-patient claim will be deducted from the refund due and you will be liable for any charge relating to in-patient care.
